## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### 1. Don't Copy, Adapt
- Smith.ai built their approach for their market
- Capture Client may have different strengths
- Focus on differentiation, not pure imitation
- Example: If you have simpler setup, emphasize that over their complex playbooks

### 2. Quality Over Quantity
- Smith.ai has 20+ case studies because they're REAL
- Don't fabricate—build genuine case studies with real clients
- 5 high-quality case studies > 20 fake ones

### 3. Start Small, Scale Fast
- Don't try to build everything at once
- Week 1 priority: Navigation + top 3 industry pages
- Validate approach, then scale to remaining industries

### 4. Integration Depth Matters
- Don't claim 7,000 integrations if you only have Zapier
- Focus on deep native integrations for top 5-10 tools
- Deep integration with GoHighLevel > shallow integration with 100 tools

### 5. Partner Programs Require Resources
- Smith.ai has dedicated partner managers
- Start with Affiliate only (easiest to manage)
- Scale to Agency/Technology partners after proving model

## 📞 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Review** all 10 research documents (prioritize Executive Summary)
2. **Decide** on Phase 1 priorities (navigation? industries? pricing?)
3. **Assign** tasks to team members (use Implementation Checklist)
4. **Create** project tracking (GitHub issues, project board)
5. **Start** with "Who We Serve" mega-menu (highest ROI)

### Decision Points to Make

**Question 1:** Which industries to prioritize first?
**Recommendation:** Legal, Home Services, Medical (Smith.ai's top 3 by case study volume)

**Question 2:** How many integrations to build initially?
**Recommendation:** Top 10 (GoHighLevel, Calendly, ServiceTitan, HubSpot, Zapier, Salesforce, Slack, Clio, Jobber, Housecall Pro)

**Question 3:** Partner program - start small or go big?
**Recommendation:** Start with Affiliate only, expand to Agency after 50 affiliates

**Question 4:** Pricing model - per-call, monthly, or both?
**Recommendation:** Offer both (like Smith.ai) to appeal to different buyer types

---

- **Comprehensive navigation** capturing every search intent
- **Massive integration ecosystem** creating customer lock-in

4. **Building** an agency-focused partner program (leverage GHL agencies)
