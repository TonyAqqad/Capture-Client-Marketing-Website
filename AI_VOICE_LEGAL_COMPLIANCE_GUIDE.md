## FCC AI Robocall Rules (2024-2025)

### February 2024 Declaratory Ruling

On **February 8, 2024**, the FCC unanimously ruled that:
- AI-generated voices are considered "artificial" under the TCPA
- This ruling applies to voice cloning technology and AI-generated speech
- The rule took effect **immediately**
- Prior express consent is required for all AI-generated voice calls

### August 2024 Proposed Rules (NPRM)

On **August 7, 2024**, the FCC proposed additional requirements:

1. **Definition of AI-Generated Calls:**
   - "A call that uses any technology or tool to artificially generate a voice or text using computational technology or other machine learning, including predictive algorithms, and large language models, to process natural language and produce voice or text content to communicate with a called party over an outbound telephone call."

2. **Two New Requirements (Proposed):**
   - **Prior Express Written Consent:** Must obtain PEWC specifically for using AI-generated content (separate from general call consent)
   - **AI Disclosure Requirement:** Must "clearly disclose" the use of AI at the beginning of each call or text

3. **Timeline:**
   - Comment period closed October 25, 2024
   - Rules expected to be adopted in 2025
   - Implementation timeline TBD after adoption

#### 8. AI Transparency and Explainability

```markdown
## How Our AI Makes Decisions

**AI Decision-Making:**
Our Voice AI uses the following process:
1. Speech Recognition: Converts your speech to text
2. Natural Language Understanding: Analyzes intent and meaning
3. Decision Logic: Applies rules and trained models
4. Response Generation: Creates appropriate response
5. Speech Synthesis: Converts response to AI voice

**What Influences AI Responses:**
- Your spoken input and conversation history
- Pre-programmed business rules and workflows
- Machine learning models trained on conversation data
- Your customer profile and preferences
- Context from previous interactions

**Automated Decision-Making:**
We use AI to make automated decisions about:
- Call routing and agent assignment
- Basic customer service responses
- Appointment scheduling and reminders
- [Other automated decisions]

**High-Risk Decisions:**
The following decisions are NOT made solely by AI without human review:
- [Credit decisions, employment decisions, etc.]
- [Medical or health-related determinations]
- [Legal or compliance decisions]

**Your Right to Human Review:**
You may request human review of any AI decision by:
- Asking during the call: "I'd like to speak to a human"
- Contacting customer service at [number]
- Emailing [customer service email]
```
