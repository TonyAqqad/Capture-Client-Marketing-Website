## Questions & Answers

**Q: What if Google changes their algorithm?**
A: These are foundational best practices (schema markup, internal linking) that have been stable for 5+ years and are explicitly recommended by Google. Low risk of sudden changes.

**Q: Can we do this in-house or need an agency?**
A: All code examples are provided. Any developer familiar with Next.js and TypeScript can implement Phase 1 in 1 week. No agency required.

**Q: What's the minimum viable implementation?**
A: Phase 1 only (BreadcrumbList + internal linking) still delivers +25% traffic increase for $4k investment. Phases 2-3 are optional enhancements.

**Q: How long until we see results?**
A: Google typically processes schema changes within 1-2 weeks. Breadcrumbs appear first (week 2-3), FAQs take longer (week 4-8), full traffic impact by month 2-3.

**Q: What if a competitor copies our strategy?**
A: First-mover advantage matters. Even if copied, your established authority + link signals give you an edge. Plus, continuous optimization keeps you ahead.
