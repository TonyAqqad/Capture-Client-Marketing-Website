## 1. Federal Regulations: FCC & TCPA Requirements

### 1.1 FCC Declaratory Ruling (February 2024) - IMMEDIATE EFFECT

**Status:** Active and Enforceable

**Key Ruling:** On February 8, 2024, the FCC issued a declaratory ruling that **AI-generated voices constitute "artificial or prerecorded voice[s]" under the TCPA**.

**Source:** [FCC Confirms TCPA Applies to AI Technologies that Generate Human Voices](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-confirms-tcpa-applies-ai-technologies-generate-human-voices)

#### What This Means:
- All AI voice agents are now classified as "artificial or prerecorded voice" under TCPA
- **No carve-out for "live agent equivalent" technologies** - even if a human controls the AI voice in real-time, it's still considered artificial
- Applies to **outbound calls only** (inbound calls answered by AI are NOT covered by TCPA)

#### Compliance Requirements:

**For Informational Calls (Non-Marketing):**
- Requires **prior express consent** from the called party

**For Marketing/Telemarketing Calls:**
- Requires **prior express WRITTEN consent** from the called party
- Must comply with National Do Not Call Registry
- Must provide opt-out mechanisms

**Status:** Was scheduled for January 27, 2025, but **vacated by 11th Circuit Court of Appeals**

**Original Requirement:** Businesses must obtain consent for "a single seller at a time" - meaning generic consent to receive marketing calls from "partners" or "third parties" would not be valid.

**Current Status:** This specific rule has been struck down, but best practice is still to obtain specific, clear consent for your business.

Capture Client provides AI-powered voice assistant technology ("Voice AI Agents")
to handle incoming customer calls for your business. Our Voice AI Agents use
artificial intelligence and machine learning to engage with callers, answer
questions, qualify leads, schedule appointments, and transfer calls to your
team when necessary.

### AI Technology Disclosure
Our Voice AI Agents utilize artificial intelligence technology to generate
human-like voice responses in real-time. While designed to provide accurate
and helpful information, Voice AI Agents are not human employees. Your customers
will be interacting with an AI-powered system when calling your business.

### Your Responsibilities

**Customer Disclosure:**
You agree to disclose to your customers that calls may be answered by an
AI-powered assistant. We recommend including language on your website such as:
"Calls may be answered by our AI assistant" or similar disclosure.

**Compliance with Telemarketing Laws:**
If you use Voice AI services for outbound calling or marketing purposes, you
are solely responsible for:

1. Obtaining prior express written consent from call recipients as required by
   the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and applicable state laws
2. Including clear disclosure in consent forms that calls may include
   AI-generated voice content
3. Complying with the National Do Not Call Registry requirements
4. Providing clear opt-out mechanisms (e.g., "Reply STOP to unsubscribe")
5. Honoring consent revocation requests immediately
6. Maintaining records of consent for at least four (4) years
7. Complying with all applicable federal, state, and local telemarketing
   regulations

**State-Specific Requirements:**
Additional disclosure and compliance requirements may apply under laws in Utah,
Colorado, California, and other states. You are responsible for ensuring
compliance with all applicable state laws governing AI-powered communications.

You may not use Voice AI services for:
- Fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading purposes
- Unauthorized impersonation or voice cloning
- Violation of any consumer protection law or regulation
- Making unsolicited calls to consumers who have not provided proper consent

### Regulatory Compliance
Our Voice AI technology complies with FCC regulations classifying AI-generated
voices as "artificial or prerecorded voice" under the TCPA (effective February
2024). You acknowledge that Voice AI calls are subject to TCPA requirements
including consent, disclosure, and opt-out provisions.

### Call Recording and Data Processing
Voice AI interactions may be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for quality
assurance, training, compliance monitoring, and service improvement purposes.
You are responsible for complying with applicable call recording consent laws
in your jurisdiction and notifying your customers of recording as required by law.

### Changes to Regulatory Requirements
AI calling regulations are evolving. We will notify you of material changes to
regulatory requirements affecting Voice AI services. You agree to cooperate in
implementing necessary compliance updates.

### Limitation of Liability
You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your use of Voice AI services
and any legal consequences arising from non-compliance with telemarketing laws,
consumer protection regulations, or disclosure requirements. Capture Client is
not liable for penalties, fines, or damages resulting from your improper use of
Voice AI technology.

third parties.

### Call Recording Notice and Consent

Florida, Pennsylvania), our Voice AI agents will provide notice that calls may
be recorded. Clients are responsible for ensuring compliance with call recording
laws in their jurisdiction.

consent requirements and to notify their customers of recording where required
by law.

### Your Rights

**Access:** You may request copies of voice recordings and transcripts related

## Conclusion

**Key Takeaway:** AI voice calling services are heavily regulated under federal TCPA rules (effective immediately) and emerging state laws. Compliance requires:

1. **Prior express WRITTEN consent** for outbound marketing calls
2. **AI-specific disclosure language** in consent forms (prepare for FCC rules)
3. **Beginning-of-call disclosure** that AI technology is being used (proposed, but best practice)
4. **Transparency** in Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
5. **State-specific compliance** for Utah, Colorado, California customers
6. **Google Ads compliance** for phone number verification and fraud prevention

**Recommendation:** Implement recommended disclosures and consent language NOW, even before final FCC rules are adopted, to ensure full compliance and build customer trust.
