## Localization Strategy Applied

### Formula for Authentic Local Content:
1. **Mention 2-3 specific business districts/landmarks** in the intro
2. **Reference local chamber of commerce** when applicable
3. **Include neighborhood names** throughout use cases
4. **Mention local industries** (tech in Alpharetta, tourism in Savannah, military in Columbus/Augusta)
5. **Make it sound like a local wrote it** - not generic

### Before vs. After Example:

**BEFORE (Generic):**
```
"Looking for voice AI services in Atlanta? Our AI agents help local businesses capture more leads."
```

**AFTER (Localized):**
```
"From the bustling offices at Perimeter Center to the thriving startups in Atlantic Station,
Atlanta businesses are discovering the power of AI voice agents. Whether you're serving clients
near Buckhead's financial district, managing calls from your Midtown office, or running a home
services company along the Fulton Industrial corridor, our 24/7 AI receptionist ensures you never
miss a lead. Trusted by businesses across the Metro Atlanta Chamber network."
```
