      "objection": "Will AI understand medical terminology?",
      "response": "Our AI is trained on millions of healthcare conversations and understands medical/dental terminology better than most human receptionists. We customize the AI to your specific specialty and can even train it on your practice's unique protocols."
    },
    {
      "objection": "What if the AI makes a scheduling mistake?",
      "response": "Our system has 99.7% accuracy - higher than human receptionists. For added safety, all appointments sync in real-time with your EHR, and your staff can review/modify any booking before it's confirmed."
    },
    {
      "objection": "My patients are older and prefer talking to humans",
      "response": "Studies show 78% of patients prefer 24/7 AI availability over business-hours-only human receptionists. Our AI is conversational and patient - many patients don't even realize they're talking to AI. Plus, complex cases still escalate to your team."
    },
    {
      "objection": "Is this really HIPAA compliant?",
      "response": "Absolutely. We're SOC 2 Type II certified, sign a BAA with every client, and use 256-bit encryption. Our compliance documentation is available for review, and many of our clients have passed HIPAA audits while using our system."
    },
    {
      "objection": "We already have a receptionist - why do we need AI?",
      "response": "AI doesn't replace your receptionist - it makes them superhuman. Your receptionist can focus on complex patient needs while AI handles routine calls, after-hours inquiries, and overflow. Practices report staff are happier and less burned out."
    },
    {
      "objection": "What if our EHR isn't supported?",
      "response": "We integrate with 20+ major EHRs including Epic, Cerner, Athena, and all major dental PMS systems. If yours isn't on the list yet, we can build custom integrations for Enterprise clients, or use universal APIs for appointment booking."

      "objection": "Setup sounds complicated",
      "response": "Most practices are live in under 5 business days. Our team handles the entire setup: EHR integration, call forwarding, AI training on your protocols, and staff training. You just need to provide access and answer a few questions about how you want calls handled."
    },
    {
      "objection": "What happens if the AI doesn't understand a caller?",
      "response": "Our AI handles 45-50% of calls completely autonomously. When it encounters something unfamiliar, it smoothly transfers to your team with full context of what was already discussed - no patient frustration from repeating themselves."
