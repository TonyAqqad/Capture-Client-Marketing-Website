    "title": "The $47,000 Mistake That Started It All",
    "paragraphs": [
      "In 2022, our founder ran a successful home services company in Knoxville, Tennessee. Business was growing, the team was busy, and everything seemed great on paper. But there was a hidden problem bleeding money.",
      "A routine audit revealed the truth: 47% of incoming calls were going unanswered. During peak hours, on weekends, and after 5 PM, potential customers were calling and getting voicemail. Most never called back. Conservative math showed we were leaving $47,000 in revenue on the table that year alone.",
      "The typical solutions were not good enough. Hiring a full-time receptionist meant $40,000+ in salary for someone who could only work 40 hours a week. Answering services were expensive, impersonal, and still missed calls during high-volume periods. After trying every option on the market and being disappointed by each one, the decision was made: build something better.",
      "That frustration became Capture Client. We combined enterprise-grade AI voice technology with years of small business marketing experience to create a solution that actually works for businesses like ours. Today, we serve 500+ companies across the country, and we have helped capture more than 50,000 leads that would have otherwise been lost to voicemail."
