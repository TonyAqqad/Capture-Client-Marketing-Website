    "paragraph": "Your potential customers are searching for your services on Google right now. The question is: are they finding you, or are they finding your competitors? Google Ads puts your business at the top of search results when people are actively looking for what you offer. But here's the problem most service businesses face—they waste thousands on Google Ads that don't convert. Clicks are expensive, keywords are competitive, and if you don't know what you're doing, you'll burn through budget fast with nothing to show for it. That's where we come in. At Capture Client, we specialize in Google Ads management exclusively for service-based businesses. We don't work with e-commerce stores or SaaS companies—we focus 100% on businesses like HVAC companies, plumbers, electricians, law firms, and medical practices that need high-quality local leads. Our campaigns are built around one goal: maximum ROI. We optimize every dollar of ad spend to generate qualified leads that turn into paying customers. We use Google Search Ads to capture high-intent buyers, Local Service Ads to dominate local search with the Google Guaranteed badge, and remarketing to bring back visitors who didn't convert the first time. Our average client sees a 4:1 return on ad spend within 60 days. That means for every $1,000 you invest in Google Ads, you get $4,000 back in revenue."

    {
      "question": "How much should I spend on Google Ads?",
      "answer": "We recommend starting with at least $1,000-$1,500 per month in ad spend to generate meaningful data and results. This budget allows us to test keywords, optimize campaigns, and drive consistent leads. Our Growth package manages $1,000-$3,000 in monthly ad spend. For larger budgets or competitive markets, our Enterprise package handles $3,000+ per month. The key is that your ad spend is separate from our management fee—you control the budget."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I see results from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "You'll start seeing traffic and leads within 24-48 hours of launching your campaigns. However, optimal performance takes 30-60 days as we gather data, identify winning keywords, and optimize bids. The beauty of Google Ads is that you can pause or adjust spending at any time. Unlike SEO which takes 6-12 months, paid search delivers immediate results that improve rapidly with expert management."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Google Search Ads and Local Service Ads?",
      "answer": "Google Search Ads appear at the top of search results with 'Ad' labels and charge per click. Local Service Ads appear above Search Ads with the Google Guaranteed badge and charge per lead (calls or messages). LSAs are only available for certain home service businesses and require Google screening. We recommend running both for maximum visibility and lead volume."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you require long-term contracts?",
      "answer": "No. We don't lock you into long-term contracts because we believe in earning your business every month through results. You can cancel with 30 days' notice. That said, Google Ads is most effective as a long-term strategy—the longer campaigns run, the more data we collect and the better we can optimize for your specific business."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you track ROI from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "We implement comprehensive conversion tracking that monitors every call, form submission, and chat from your ads. You'll see exactly how many leads each campaign generates, cost per lead, and which keywords drive the most conversions. We connect this data to your CRM when possible to track leads all the way to closed deals. Full transparency on every dollar spent."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help if I've tried Google Ads before and failed?",
      "answer": "Absolutely—this is our specialty. Most service businesses fail at Google Ads because they target the wrong keywords, write weak ad copy, send traffic to poor landing pages, or don't optimize based on data. We'll audit your previous campaigns, identify what went wrong, and build a new strategy focused on ROI. Many of our best clients came to us after wasting money on DIY or poorly managed campaigns."

        "heading": "Why Google Ads is Essential for Service Business Growth",
        "content": "Google processes over 8.5 billion searches per day. A significant percentage of those searches are people looking for local services—'plumber near me,' 'emergency HVAC repair,' 'personal injury lawyer,' 'dentist accepting new patients.' These are high-intent searches from people ready to hire someone TODAY. If your business isn't showing up in these search results, you're invisibly to a massive stream of potential customers. Organic SEO is great, but it takes 6-12 months to rank on page one. Google Ads puts you at the very top immediately. You control your visibility and lead flow. Need more leads this week? Increase your budget. Fully booked? Pause campaigns. This level of control is impossible with any other marketing channel. For service businesses, Google Ads consistently delivers the highest quality leads at the most predictable costs. Unlike social media where you're interrupting people, search ads capture existing demand. People searching Google are actively looking for solutions right now. Your job is simply to be there when they search. The businesses winning in their local markets are the ones investing in Google Ads with expert management. DIY Google Ads rarely work because the platform is complex and expensive to learn through trial and error. That's why our managed service focuses exclusively on maximizing your ROI from day one."

      {
        "heading": "The Power of Google Local Service Ads",
        "content": "If you run a home service business, Local Service Ads (LSAs) are a game-changer. LSAs appear at the very top of Google search results—above traditional search ads, above everything. They feature your business name, star rating, phone number, and the coveted Google Guaranteed badge. This badge tells customers that Google has screened and verified your business. If a customer isn't satisfied with your work, Google may cover the cost up to the job invoice amount. This builds instant trust. LSAs use a pay-per-lead model instead of pay-per-click. You only pay when someone calls or messages you directly from the ad. No more paying for accidental clicks or people just browsing. You pay for actual leads. The cost per lead varies by market and service type but typically runs $15-$75 per lead depending on competition. For high-value services, this is incredibly cost-effective. To qualify for LSAs, Google requires background checks, license verification, and insurance documentation. This screening process actually works in your favor—it keeps out low-quality competitors and positions you as a trusted, verified service provider. We handle the entire LSA setup process including Google screening, profile optimization, review management, and bid optimization. Most clients see LSAs become their #1 lead source within 60 days."
