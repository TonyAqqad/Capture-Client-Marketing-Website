## FAQ Section (Real Estate Specific)

### Common Questions

**Q: "How does the AI sound? Will my clients know it's not a human?"**
A: The AI uses natural language processing trained specifically for real estate conversations. It handles questions about school districts, HOA fees, square footage, and more. Most callers can't tell they're speaking with AI - and they don't care as long as they get instant answers.

**Q: "What happens if the AI can't answer a question?"**
A: The AI is trained on your property listings, but if it encounters a question it can't answer confidently, it offers to take a message or transfer the call to you immediately. You're always in control.

**Q: "Can it handle multiple calls at once?"**
A: Yes! Unlike a human ISA who can only handle one call at a time, the AI can answer unlimited simultaneous calls. Perfect during open houses or when multiple listings go viral.

**Q: "Does it work with my Zillow Premier Agent account?"**
A: Absolutely. The AI integrates with Zillow lead notifications and responds within seconds. Many agents see 2-3x better conversion rates on Zillow leads because they're always first to respond.

**Q: "What about my existing ISA team?"**
A: The AI complements your team by handling after-hours calls, overflow during busy periods, and initial qualification. Your human ISAs can focus on complex leads and relationship building.

**Q: "How long does setup take?"**
A: 10-15 minutes. We connect to your CRM, import your listings, customize the AI greeting, and you're live. No technical expertise required.

**Q: "What's the contract length?"**
A: Month-to-month. No long-term commitment. If you're not capturing more leads in the first 30 days, cancel anytime.

**Q: "Can it schedule showings in my calendar?"**
A: Yes. It connects to Google Calendar, Outlook, or Calendly, checks your availability, books the showing, and sends you + the lead confirmation and reminders.
