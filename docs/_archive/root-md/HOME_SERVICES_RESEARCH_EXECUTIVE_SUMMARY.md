## ROI Calculator Formula

```
Monthly Missed Calls = Monthly Calls × 0.27
Lost Customers = Missed Calls × 0.85
Monthly Revenue Loss = Lost Customers × Average Job Value
Annual Loss = Monthly Loss × 12

AI Service Cost = $99-$399/month
Monthly Savings = Revenue Loss - AI Cost
ROI % = (Monthly Savings / AI Cost) × 100
Break-Even Jobs = AI Cost / Average Job Profit
```

### Example Calculation (HVAC Contractor)
- 50 calls/month × 27% miss rate = **13.5 missed calls**
- 13.5 × 85% won't callback = **11.5 lost customers**
- 11.5 × $500 avg job = **$5,750/month loss**
- $5,750 × 12 = **$69,000/year loss**
- $5,750 - $200 AI cost = **$5,550/month savings**
- ($5,550 / $200) × 100 = **2,775% ROI**
