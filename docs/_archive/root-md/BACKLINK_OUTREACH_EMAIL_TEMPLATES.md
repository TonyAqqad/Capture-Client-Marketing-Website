### Broken Link Building
**Do:**
- Actually visit the broken link to confirm it's dead
- Provide exact location (section, anchor text)
- Suggest your replacement as one option (not the only option)
- Be helpful first, promotional second
- Offer multiple replacement suggestions (yours + others)

**Don't:**
- Lie about broken links to force your content in
- Only suggest your own content as replacement
- Ignore context (is your replacement actually relevant?)
- Follow up aggressively (you're asking a favor)
- Target pages with dozens of broken links (they're abandoned)

**Best Days to Send:** Monday-Thursday, 9-11 AM
**Expected Response Time:** 3-10 days
**Benchmark Response Rate:** 30-50%

## PERSONALIZATION TIPS

### Finding Contact Names
**Methods:**
1. Check website About page
2. Look at LinkedIn company page
3. Search "[Company Name] editor" or "[Company Name] content manager"
4. Check recent blog post author bios
5. Use Hunter.io or similar email finder tools

**If You Can't Find Name:**
- Use "Hi there" or "Hello [Company Name] team"
- "Hi [Blog Name] editor"
- Be honest: "I couldn't find the right contact name, so I hope this reaches the right person"

### Customization Points
**High-Impact Personalization:**
1. Reference a specific recent article (show you read their content)
2. Mention why their audience would benefit (demographics, interests)
3. Connect your content to their existing themes
4. Use their terminology and voice
5. Show familiarity with their brand values

**Low-Value Personalization (Avoid):**
- Just inserting company name in template
- Generic compliments ("great website!")
- Obvious mail merge fields [FIRSTNAME]

### Research Checklist Before Sending
- [ ] Verified contact email (not generic info@)
- [ ] Read 3-5 recent pieces of their content
- [ ] Checked their existing backlinks (avoid duplicate pitches)
- [ ] Reviewed their editorial guidelines (if guest posting)
- [ ] Confirmed they accept submissions/suggestions
- [ ] Found actual contact name (when possible)
- [ ] Customized at least 3 sentences specifically for them

## COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### Objection 1: "We don't accept guest posts"
**Response:**
```
Totally understand! Would you be open to:
- Expert quotes for upcoming articles?
- Data/statistics from our research?
- Interviews about Voice AI trends?

No pressure - just wanted to offer alternative ways to contribute value.
```

### Objection 2: "Your content isn't relevant to our audience"
**Response:**
```
Thanks for the feedback! I clearly misread the audience fit.

Quick question: What topics ARE you looking for right now? I might be able to contribute in a different way, or I might know someone in my network who'd be a better fit.

Either way, appreciate you taking the time to respond!
```

### Objection 3: "We require payment for listings/links"
**Response (If Reasonable Price):**
```
Thanks for letting me know! What are the pricing options?

Could you also share:
- Traffic stats for the directory/page?
- Domain authority?
- How many businesses are listed?

I want to make sure it's a good fit before committing.
```

**Response (If Unreasonable Price):**
```
Thanks for the information! That's a bit outside our budget right now, but I'll keep it in mind for the future.

Do you offer any free listing options, even if they're more limited?
```

### Objection 4: "Your link seems too promotional"
**Response:**
```
I completely understand - I don't want to add promotional content to your resource page either!

Would a link to our free ROI calculator be more appropriate? It's genuinely free (no email required) and educational rather than promotional:
[Calculator URL]

Or if that's still too promotional, no worries at all. Thanks for curating quality resources!
```

### Objection 5: "We already have too many resources on this topic"
**Response:**
```
That makes total sense - I can see your [Topic] section is already comprehensive.

Are there any OTHER topics you're looking to expand? I might have resources for:
- [Alternative Topic 1]
- [Alternative Topic 2]
- [Alternative Topic 3]

If not, no problem! Thanks for considering it.
```

### Objection 6: "Can you link to us first?"
**Response (If Relevant):**
```
Absolutely! I'd be happy to link to your [relevant resource] from our [relevant page] - it's genuinely valuable for our audience.

I'll add that link this week and send you the URL once it's live.
```

**Response (If Not Relevant):**
```
I'd love to, but I want to make sure any links I add provide real value to our readers. Do you have content specifically about [Capture Client's topics: Voice AI, lead generation, etc.]?

If so, I'd be happy to link to it from our blog or resources section!
```

### Objection 7: "You need to be a member/customer first"
**Response:**
```
That's a fair policy! Could you share more about membership/customer benefits?

Specifically:
- Cost?
- What's included?
- How many members do you have?
- Any networking or marketing benefits beyond the listing?

I want to make sure it's a good investment for Capture Client.
```

## FINAL TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### Quality Over Quantity
- 10 highly personalized emails > 100 generic templates
- One high-authority backlink > Ten low-quality directory links
- Focus on relevance and editorial value

### Build Relationships
- Engage with their content before pitching
- Share their articles on social media
- Comment thoughtfully on their blog posts
- Think long-term (today's "no" could be next month's "yes")

### Be Genuinely Helpful
- Offer value without expecting anything in return
- Share useful data, insights, or resources
- Help them solve problems (broken links, outdated info)
- Think "How can I help them?" not "How can they help me?"

### Stay Organized
- Track all outreach in spreadsheet or CRM
- Note personalization details for follow-ups
- Set reminders for follow-up emails
- Document what works (and what doesn't)

### Respect Their Time
- Keep emails concise (200-300 words max)
- Make it easy to say yes (clear, simple ask)
- Don't follow up more than 2-3 times
- Accept "no" gracefully and move on
