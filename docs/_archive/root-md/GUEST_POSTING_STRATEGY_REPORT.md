## Competitor Analysis: Who's Winning at Guest Posting?

### Top Competitors to Study

**1. Analyze their backlink profile:**
- Use Ahrefs or SEMrush to see where competitors are publishing
- Identify blogs accepting their guest posts
- Study their most linked-to content

**2. Reverse engineer their pitch:**
- Read their published guest posts
- Note topics that got accepted
- Analyze writing style and structure

**3. Go where they haven't:**
- Find gaps in their guest posting strategy
- Target blogs they've missed
- Differentiate your pitch angle

### Example Competitive Research

**Competitor:** [AI Marketing Agency X]

**Their Published Guest Posts:**
1. TechCrunch - "How AI is Changing Marketing"
2. MarketingProfs - "AI Tools for Marketers"
3. Entrepreneur - "Starting an AI Business"

**Capture Client's Differentiation:**
- Focus on Voice AI specifically (more niche)
- Emphasize small business angle (vs. enterprise)
- Local SEO focus (Southeast US)
- Real case studies with ROI data

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Content Ownership
- **Always clarify:** Do you retain rights after publication?
- **Most blogs:** Non-exclusive rights (you can republish after certain period)
- **Some blogs:** Exclusive rights (cannot republish elsewhere)
- **Read terms carefully**

### Disclosure Requirements
- **FTC Guidelines:** Disclose if you're being compensated
- **Backlinks:** Most blogs allow 1-2 do-follow links (check guidelines)
- **Sponsored content:** Must be clearly labeled

### Plagiarism & AI Content
- **Use original content only**
- **Many blogs check for plagiarism** (they'll reject if found)
- **AI-generated content:** Many blogs explicitly prohibit (VentureBeat, Entrepreneurship Life, etc.)
- **Use AI for outlines/research only**, write yourself

### Attribution
- **Cite sources** when using statistics
- **Link to original research**
- **Give credit** for ideas/quotes
