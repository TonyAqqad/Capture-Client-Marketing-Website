# UNSPLASH LOCAL LANDMARK SEARCH - EXPERT TIPS

## THE PROBLEM WITH CURRENT IMAGES

### Current Generic Photos Being Used:
1. **Growtika tech network** (`photo-1674027444485-cec3da58eef4`) - Abstract tech nodes
   - Used on: Chattanooga, Memphis, and others
   - Problem: Zero local context, generic AI aesthetic

2. **Business professional headshots** - Generic corporate imagery
   - Used on: Alexandria, Atlanta, and others
   - Problem: Could be ANY city, no landmark recognition

3. **Abstract technology backgrounds** - Blurred circuits and networks
   - Problem: Screams "AI slop", no authentic local connection

## WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### ✅ GOOD LOCAL LANDMARK IMAGES:

**Characteristics:**
- **Instantly recognizable**: Locals say "I know exactly where that is!"
- **High quality**: Sharp, professional composition, good lighting
- **Clear landmark**: Building, bridge, skyline, monument in focus
- **Daytime/golden hour**: Unless landmark is known for nighttime (Broadway Nashville neon)
- **No people focus**: Landmark is hero, not individuals
- **Professional photography**: Not tourist snapshots
- **FREE**: Standard Unsplash license (not Plus/Premium)

**Examples of PERFECT searches:**
- "Walnut Street Bridge Chattanooga" → Iconic pedestrian bridge
- "Sunsphere Knoxville" → Unique 1982 World's Fair tower
- "Broadway Nashville neon" → Famous honky-tonk strip
- "Forsyth Park Savannah" → Historic fountain and park
- "Old Well UNC Chapel Hill" → Iconic neoclassical rotunda
- "Roebling Bridge Cincinnati" → Historic suspension bridge

### ❌ AVOID THESE IMAGE TYPES:

**Generic business photos:**
- Office workers at computers
- Generic conference rooms
- Abstract handshakes
- Stock photo business people

**Too abstract:**
- Circuit boards
- Abstract tech networks
- Blurred bokeh backgrounds
- Generic architecture (could be anywhere)

**Poor quality:**
- Tourist phone snapshots
- Blurry or poorly composed
- Wrong aspect ratio
- Dark/underexposed

**People-focused:**
- Individual portraits
- Crowds as main subject
- Close-ups of faces

**Premium/Plus images:**
- Look for "Plus" or "Premium" badge
- These require paid license - SKIP

**Step 2: Quality Check**
Click promising images and verify:
- High resolution (1920px+ width)

- Natural features or university

**Step 4: Regional Fallback** (for small cities)
If specific city has limited results:

- Try nearby major city + "[State]"

## HANDLING DIFFICULT CITIES

### Small Cities with Limited Landmark Photography

**Problem**: City has no iconic landmarks on Unsplash

**Solution hierarchy**:
1. Try "[City] [State] downtown" - might find main street
2. Try "[City] courthouse" or "[City] city hall" - historic buildings
3. Try "[State] [Region]" - use regional geography
4. Try nearest major city + state context
5. Last resort: Use state landmark + caption clarifying location

**Example - Oak Ridge, TN**:
- Primary search: "Oak Ridge Tennessee" - limited results
- Alternative: "East Tennessee mountains" - regional context
- Or: "Knoxville Tennessee" + caption "Serving Oak Ridge and East Tennessee"

### Cities with Common Names

**Problem**: "Arlington" returns Virginia, Texas, and Massachusetts results

**Solution**:
- ALWAYS include state in search: "Arlington Virginia" or "Arlington Texas"
- Add specific landmark: "Arlington Texas AT&T Stadium"
- Add context: "Crystal City Arlington Virginia"

### Beach/Coastal Cities

**Florida Gulf Coast, Virginia Beach, etc.**

**Best approach**:
- Use "[City] beach" or "[City] oceanfront"
- Search for specific beaches: "Virginia Beach boardwalk"
- Include skyline from beach: "Miami beach skyline"

### Suburban Cities

**Alpharetta, Sandy Springs, Plano, Frisco, etc.**

**Best approach**:
- Search for specific developments: "Avalon Alpharetta", "Legacy West Plano"
- Use metro context: "[City] [Metro Area] suburbs"
- Fall back to nearby major city skyline + clear caption

4. **Daytime over night** (usually): Unless landmark is famous for nighttime (Broadway Nashville, Beale Street)

5. **Check image dimensions**: Make sure it's at least 1920px wide

6. **Avoid Unsplash+**: Look for "Plus" or "Premium" badges and skip those

7. **Document as you go**: Add to CSV immediately after each search

8. **Batch by state**: Do all Tennessee cities, then all Georgia, etc. - you'll get faster

9. **Quality over speed**: One perfect landmark image beats 10 mediocre generic photos

10. **Think like a local**: If you lived in this city, what would make you say "Yes, that's MY city!"
