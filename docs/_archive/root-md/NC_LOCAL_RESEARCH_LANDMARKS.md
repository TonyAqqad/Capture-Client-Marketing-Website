## CONTENT LOCALIZATION STRATEGY

Each location page should include:

1. **Geographic specificity**: Named business districts, not generic "downtown"
2. **Industry context**: Dominant local industries mentioned naturally
3. **Chamber/organization references**: Build local credibility
4. **Neighborhood mentions**: Show intimate local knowledge
5. **Regional identity**: Connect to broader regional context (Triangle, Triad, etc.)
6. **Local business challenges**: Address city-specific pain points
7. **Success metrics tailored**: Industry-appropriate ROI examples

This creates content that feels authentically written by someone who knows the local market, not AI-generated generic SEO fluff.
