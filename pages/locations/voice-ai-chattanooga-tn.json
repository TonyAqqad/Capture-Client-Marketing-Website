      "question": "What's the ROI for Chattanooga businesses?",
      "answer": "Most Chattanooga clients see 3-5x ROI within 60 days. If you're currently missing even 10% of calls (industry average is 30%), and your average customer value is $1,000 - Voice AI pays for itself quickly. Plus you save on staffing costs and opportunity costs from missed leads."
