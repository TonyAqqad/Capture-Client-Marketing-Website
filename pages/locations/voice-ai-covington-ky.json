  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does Voice AI work for Covington businesses?",
      "answer": "Our AI voice agents act as your 24/7 virtual receptionist for your Covington business. They answer calls with natural conversation, provide information about your services, ask qualifying questions, book appointments into your calendar, and transfer urgent calls when needed. The AI is custom-trained on your business, your Northern Kentucky service areas, and your specific processes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of Covington businesses benefit from Voice AI?",
      "answer": "We work with service-based businesses throughout Covington and Northern Kentucky including home services (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roofing), medical and dental practices, law firms, real estate professionals, contractors, property managers, and any business that relies on phone inquiries to generate revenue."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does Voice AI cost for Covington businesses?",
      "answer": "Our packages start at $997/month with setup included, covering unlimited calls and continuous optimization. Most Covington businesses achieve positive ROI within 30 days - often from just one recovered lead. Compare this to hiring a receptionist at $32,000-$40,000 annually plus benefits, training, and management overhead."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the AI handle Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati inquiries?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We train your AI on all the areas you serve, whether that's just Covington, all of Kenton County, broader Northern Kentucky, or Greater Cincinnati. Your AI can discuss service areas, give location-specific pricing, and understand local geography perfectly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the AI encounters a question it can't answer?",
      "answer": "If your AI faces an unusual situation, it will politely take detailed information and either transfer the call immediately or send you an alert for follow-up. You set the rules - decide which situations require immediate transfer and which can wait. Most Covington businesses find their AI handles 90-95% of calls completely independently."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to set up for Covington businesses?",
      "answer": "Most Covington businesses are fully operational within 48-72 hours. We schedule an initial call, build and train your custom AI, integrate with your phone and scheduling systems, conduct testing, and launch. You review everything to ensure it perfectly represents your brand before we go live."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it work with our existing Covington phone number?",
      "answer": "Yes! We integrate seamlessly with your current phone system. Your Covington customers call the same number they always have - they just experience better, faster service with 24/7 availability. No need to change numbers or update marketing materials."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of results do Covington businesses see?",
      "answer": "Typical results for Covington businesses include 40-60% more leads captured, 30-50% reduction in cost per lead, significant time savings for owners and staff, and positive ROI within 30-60 days. The businesses that see the best results are those missing calls regularly or spending too much time qualifying unqualified leads."
