  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does Voice AI work for my Owensboro business?",
      "answer": "Our AI voice agent acts as your 24/7 virtual receptionist. When Owensboro customers call, the AI answers professionally, discusses your services, answers common questions, qualifies leads based on your criteria, books appointments into your calendar, and transfers urgent calls when needed. It's trained specifically on your business, so it sounds knowledgeable and professional to every caller."
    },
    {
      "question": "What Owensboro businesses benefit from Voice AI?",
      "answer": "We work with service businesses across Owensboro and Daviess County including home services (HVAC, plumbing, electrical), healthcare practices, professional services (legal, accounting), contractors, manufacturing support services, real estate, and any business that relies on phone leads. If you're an Owensboro business that gets phone inquiries, Voice AI can help."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the cost for Owensboro businesses?",
      "answer": "Our standard package is $997/month including unlimited calls, custom AI training, phone system integration, and ongoing optimization. Most Owensboro businesses achieve ROI within 4 weeks. Consider that one captured lead could be worth $3,000-$30,000 depending on your industry. Compare this to hiring a receptionist at $30,000+ annually or losing revenue to missed calls."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the AI handle Owensboro-specific questions?",
      "answer": "Yes! We train your AI on your specific Owensboro service areas (downtown, west Owensboro, specific Daviess County regions), your services, pricing, and local nuances. The AI can discuss details specific to your business and the Owensboro market, making every conversation feel personal and informed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when the AI can't handle a call?",
      "answer": "The AI successfully manages 85-95% of calls independently. For complex situations or emergencies you define, it seamlessly transfers to you with a conversation summary. You control which situations require immediate attention. Most Owensboro businesses configure their AI to handle routine matters completely, freeing them to focus on revenue-generating work."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast can we launch in Owensboro?",
      "answer": "Most Owensboro businesses are live within 48 hours. After our strategy call, we build and train your AI, integrate with your phone and calendar systems, and launch. You review everything before going live to ensure it represents your Owensboro business perfectly. Implementation is fast and painless."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will it work with our existing Owensboro phone number?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We integrate seamlessly with your current phone system. Your Owensboro customers call the same number they always have - they just get better, faster service with 24/7 availability. No new numbers, no complicated changes, no customer confusion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if we're not happy with the service?",
      "answer": "We offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you're not capturing more leads and saving time, we'll refund your setup investment. However, most Owensboro businesses see measurable improvements within the first week - more calls answered, more appointments booked, and more time freed up for important work."
