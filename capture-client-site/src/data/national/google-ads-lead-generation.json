  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why is Google Ads better for lead generation than Facebook Ads?",
      "answer": "Google Ads targets people with high purchase intent who are actively searching for your services RIGHT NOW. This results in 3-5x higher conversion rates compared to Facebook's interruption-based advertising. While Facebook costs $15-$50 per lead, Google Ads leads cost $50-$150 but convert at 10-20% (vs. Facebook's 5-10%). For high-value services like legal, healthcare, or B2B, Google's intent-driven traffic delivers significantly better ROI."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do Google Ads lead generation campaigns cost?",
      "answer": "Management starts at $97/month, plus your Google Ads spend budget ($1,500-$10,000/month depending on industry and competition). Legal and healthcare typically need $3,000-$7,000/month due to high CPCs. Home services average $1,500-$3,000/month. With our 4:1 average ROAS, a $3,000/month investment typically generates $12,000+ in revenue. We provide custom projections during your free audit."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I start seeing leads from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Most campaigns generate leads within 3-7 days of launch. We complete keyword research, campaign setup, ad copywriting, landing page optimization, and conversion tracking within 1-2 weeks. However, optimal performance develops over 30-60 days as Google's algorithm learns which keywords and audiences convert best. We recommend a 90-day commitment for maximum ROI."
    },
    {
      "question": "What industries benefit most from Google Ads lead generation?",
      "answer": "Google Ads excels for high-intent service businesses: Legal Services (personal injury, family law, criminal defense), Healthcare (dental, medical, veterinary), Home Services (HVAC, plumbing, roofing, electrical), Financial Services (insurance, accounting, financial advisors), and B2B (software, consulting, professional services). Any business where customers actively search for solutions benefits from Google's intent-driven traffic."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Google Search Ads and Local Service Ads?",
      "answer": "Google Search Ads appear above organic results when people search your keywords. You pay per click ($2-$100+ depending on competition). Local Service Ads appear at the very top with a Google Guaranteed badge and operate on a pay-per-lead model (you only pay for qualified calls/messages). LSAs are ideal for home services, healthcare, and local businesses. We typically run both for maximum coverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you require long-term contracts?",
      "answer": "No long-term contracts required. We offer month-to-month service with 30-day notice. However, we strongly recommend 90 days minimum because Google's algorithm needs time to optimize (typically 30-50 conversions). Our 90-day performance guarantee ensures you see measurable improvements or we make it right."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure my Google Ads budget isn't wasted?",
      "answer": "We prevent budget waste through: negative keyword lists (blocking irrelevant searches), Quality Score optimization (lowering cost per click), conversion tracking (tracking every lead to revenue), daily budget monitoring, A/B testing ad variations, landing page optimization, and geographic bid adjustments. Our clients typically see 20-40% reduction in cost per lead within 60 days while maintaining or increasing lead volume."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in Google Ads lead generation management?",
      "answer": "Complete end-to-end service: free Google Ads audit, competitor analysis, keyword research (200-500 keywords), ad copywriting (15-30 ad variations), landing page optimization, conversion tracking setup, Google Analytics integration, call tracking, AI voice agent setup for lead qualification, negative keyword management, Quality Score optimization, bid management, monthly reporting, and ongoing A/B testing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure Google Ads ROI and performance?",
      "answer": "We track every metric: impressions, click-through rate (CTR), cost per click (CPC), Quality Score, conversion rate, cost per lead, lead quality scores, appointment booking rates, show-up rates, customer conversion rates, customer lifetime value, and revenue attribution. You get real-time dashboards showing campaign performance plus monthly reports with ROI calculations and optimization recommendations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is your 90-day performance guarantee?",
      "answer": "We guarantee measurable improvements in lead quality, cost per lead, and overall ROI within 90 days. If we don't deliver on these metrics, we'll continue working at no additional cost until we hit targets, or refund the difference. This guarantee demonstrates our confidence in delivering results for your business."
