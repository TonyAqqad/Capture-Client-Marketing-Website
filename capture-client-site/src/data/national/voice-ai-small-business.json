    "paragraph": "Small business owners wear many hats but you should not have to be glued to your phone 24/7 just to capture leads. Voice AI for small business is revolutionizing how companies handle phone calls. The reality is harsh: 85 percent of callers will not leave a voicemail, and 75 percent will call a competitor if you do not answer. Voice AI technology solves this problem by providing 24/7 automated phone answering that sounds natural, asks the right qualifying questions, books appointments directly into your calendar, and routes urgent calls. Most businesses see ROI within 30-60 days."
