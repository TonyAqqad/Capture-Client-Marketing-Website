    "paragraph": "Facebook and Instagram Ads are the fastest way to generate leads for local businesses but most campaigns fail because leads never get followed up. Our Meta advertising lead generation system captures leads through optimized Facebook and Instagram campaigns with advanced targeting (lookalike audiences, geotargeting, custom audience segmentation, and full-funnel targeting), then immediately follows up with AI voice technology to qualify interest and book appointments. We leverage Meta's machine learning algorithms trained on billions of data points to identify prospects most likely to convert. Service businesses generate 30-100 qualified leads per month with conversion rates of 15-25 percent from ad click to booked appointment. Our campaigns run across both Facebook and Instagram for maximum reach, using Lead Ads that auto-fill user information for effortless form submission."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why choose Facebook Ads for lead generation over Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Facebook Ads excel at building awareness and nurturing prospects through demographic and interest-based targeting. Cost per lead is typically 50-70% lower than Google Ads ($15-$50 vs. $50-$150). Facebook is ideal for reaching people who aren't actively searching yet but match your ideal customer profile. We recommend using both platforms for a complete strategy: Facebook for awareness and nurturing, Google for capturing high-intent searchers."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much do Facebook Ads lead generation campaigns cost?",
      "answer": "Management packages start at $999/month, plus your Facebook ad spend budget ($1,000-$5,000/month recommended). Average cost per lead ranges from $15-$50 depending on industry and targeting. Most businesses see 3-5x ROI within 60-90 days. With a $2,000 ad budget, expect 40-130 leads monthly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I start getting leads from Facebook Ads?",
      "answer": "Most campaigns start generating leads within 3-7 days of launch. We complete campaign setup, audience creation, ad creative, and AI voice agent training within 1-2 weeks. Facebook's algorithm typically optimizes for best performance after 7-14 days and 50+ conversions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What industries work best with Facebook Ads lead generation?",
      "answer": "Facebook Ads perform exceptionally well for Home Services (HVAC, plumbing, landscaping), Healthcare (dental, med spas, chiropractic), Legal Services, Real Estate, Automotive, Financial Services, and B2B. Any service business targeting local customers or specific demographics benefits from Facebook's advanced targeting capabilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of conversion rates can I expect from Facebook Lead Ads?",
      "answer": "Average conversion rates range from 10-25% from ad click to lead submission (thanks to auto-fill Lead Ads), and 15-25% from lead to booked appointment (with AI follow-up). Overall, expect 2-5% end-to-end conversion from ad impression to customer. Our AI follow-up system significantly outperforms manual follow-up."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you require long-term contracts for Facebook Ads management?",
      "answer": "No long-term contracts required. We offer month-to-month service with 30-day cancellation notice. However, we recommend at least 90 days to allow Facebook's algorithm to optimize and gather sufficient conversion data for maximum performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the AI follow-up work with Facebook Lead Ads?",
      "answer": "When someone submits a Facebook Lead Ad form, their information is instantly sent to our AI voice agent system. Within 60 seconds, our AI calls or texts the lead (based on their preference), qualifies their interest using custom questions you define, answers their questions, and books appointments directly into your calendar. This speed-to-lead dramatically increases conversion rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "What targeting options are available with Facebook Ads?",
      "answer": "Facebook offers the most advanced targeting in digital advertising: demographic targeting (age, gender, income, education), interest targeting (hobbies, behaviors, pages followed), geographic targeting (city, radius, zip codes), lookalike audiences (find people similar to your best customers), custom audiences (upload customer lists), retargeting (people who visited your website), and Meta's AI-powered Advantage+ targeting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you run ads on both Facebook and Instagram?",
      "answer": "Yes! All campaigns automatically run on both Facebook and Instagram (owned by Meta) for maximum reach. We optimize creative for each platform—Facebook favors longer copy and detailed ads, while Instagram performs best with visual storytelling and shorter text. This dual-platform approach increases lead volume by 40-60% compared to Facebook alone."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure Facebook Ads lead generation ROI?",
      "answer": "We track every metric that matters: cost per lead, lead quality scores, appointment booking rates, show-up rates, customer conversion rates, and revenue attribution. You'll receive real-time dashboards showing campaign performance, A/B test results, audience insights, and monthly reports with ROI calculations. We integrate with your CRM to track the complete customer journey from ad click to closed deal."
