    "paragraph": "Contractors struggle with inconsistent lead flow, seasonal slowdowns, and competing on price. Facebook and Instagram Ads for contractors solves this by leveraging Meta's advanced targeting to reach homeowners based on home value, income level, and recent life events like moving or home purchases. Our campaigns use geotargeting with location exclusions to focus on your profitable service areas, lookalike audiences trained on your best customers, and custom audience segmentation based on demographics and behaviors. Instagram Reels and carousel ads showcase your before/after transformations, while Facebook Lead Ads make it effortless for homeowners to request quotes. Our campaigns generate 20-50 qualified leads per month for contractors with average project values of $5,000-$25,000. We handle everything from scroll-stopping ad creative featuring your best projects to lead qualification through AI voice technology, so you focus on estimates and project delivery. Run campaigns across both Facebook and Instagram to maximize reach and capture homeowners wherever they engage on Meta platforms."
