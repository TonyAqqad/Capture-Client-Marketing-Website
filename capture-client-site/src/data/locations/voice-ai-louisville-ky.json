  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does Voice AI work for Louisville businesses?",
      "answer": "Our AI voice agents answer your business calls just like a trained Louisville receptionist. They can answer questions about your services, qualify leads based on your criteria, book appointments into your calendar, and route urgent calls to you. The AI learns your business, pricing, and availability, so every caller gets accurate information and professional service."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of Louisville businesses use Voice AI?",
      "answer": "We work with service businesses across Louisville and surrounding areas like Jeffersontown, St. Matthews, and the Highlands. Our clients include contractors, medical practices, dental offices, law firms, real estate agents, home service providers, and any business that gets phone leads. If you get calls, we can help you capture more leads."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does Voice AI cost in Louisville?",
      "answer": "Our packages start at $997/month which includes setup, training, and unlimited calls. Most Louisville businesses see positive ROI within 30 days - often from just one recovered lead. Compare that to hiring a full-time receptionist at $3,000+ per month, or losing $10,000+ in missed opportunities. We also offer enterprise plans for multi-location Louisville businesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the AI handle Louisville-specific questions?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We train your AI on your specific services, service areas (whether you serve all of Jefferson County or specific Louisville neighborhoods), pricing, and availability. It can answer questions about your Louisville business as well as any trained employee. Plus, it never has a bad day or forgets important details."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to calls the AI can't handle?",
      "answer": "Our AI can handle 85-95% of incoming calls completely. For complex situations or urgent matters, it seamlessly transfers to you or takes a detailed message. You stay in control while the AI handles routine inquiries, qualification, and scheduling. Louisville businesses love this because they only get interrupted for truly important calls."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can we get started in Louisville?",
      "answer": "Most Louisville businesses are live within 48 hours of our strategy call. We handle all the technical setup, AI training, and integration with your existing phone system and calendar. You'll review the AI's responses before launch to ensure everything is perfect for your Louisville customers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Voice AI work with our existing Louisville phone number?",
      "answer": "Yes! We integrate seamlessly with your current phone system. Your Louisville customers call the same number they always have - they just get better, faster service with 24/7 availability. No complicated changes, no new numbers to promote."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if we're not satisfied with the service?",
      "answer": "We offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you're not seeing more leads captured and time saved, we'll refund your setup fee. Most Louisville businesses see results within the first week, but we give you a full month to evaluate. We're confident you'll love having an AI receptionist that never sleeps."
