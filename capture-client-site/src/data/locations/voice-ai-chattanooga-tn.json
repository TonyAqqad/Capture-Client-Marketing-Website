    {
      "question": "Can the AI handle technical questions about my Chattanooga services?",

      "question": "What's the ROI for Chattanooga businesses?",
      "answer": "Most Chattanooga clients see 3-5x ROI within 60 days. If you're currently missing even 10% of calls (industry average is 30%), and your average customer value is $1,000 - Voice AI pays for itself quickly. Plus you save on staffing costs and opportunity costs from missed leads."

      "question": "Does Voice AI work for seasonal Chattanooga businesses?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Tourism, outdoor recreation, and seasonal contractors in Chattanooga benefit tremendously. Scale up during busy seasons without hiring temporary staff, and scale down during slow periods. You only pay for the months you use it."

    {
      "question": "How quickly can my Chattanooga business get started?",
      "answer": "We can have your Voice AI live within 5-7 business days. That includes AI training, phone system setup, calendar integration, and testing. Chattanooga businesses appreciate our Gig City speed - we move fast so you can start capturing leads immediately."
