    {
      "question": "How does Voice AI work for Bowling Green businesses?",
      "answer": "Our AI voice agent answers your business phone calls 24/7, just like a well-trained receptionist. It can discuss your services, answer frequently asked questions specific to your Bowling Green business, qualify leads based on criteria you set, book appointments into your calendar, and transfer urgent calls to you. The AI is custom-trained on your business, so it sounds knowledgeable and professional to every caller."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of Bowling Green businesses use Voice AI?",
      "answer": "We serve service-based businesses throughout Bowling Green and Warren County. Our clients include automotive services, contractors, medical practices, dental offices, law firms, real estate agents, property managers, home service providers, and professional service firms. Bowling Green Area Chamber members trust our technology. Any Bowling Green business that receives phone leads can benefit from AI voice agents."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Voice AI cost for Bowling Green businesses?",
      "answer": "Our standard plan is $997/month with unlimited calls, custom AI training, and ongoing optimization. There are no hidden fees or per-call charges. Most Bowling Green businesses see positive ROI within 30 days. Compare this to hiring a receptionist at $30,000+ per year, or the revenue lost from missed calls. We also offer enterprise plans for multi-location businesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the AI understand Bowling Green-specific information?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We train your AI on your specific service areas (whether you serve all of Bowling Green, Warren County, or specific neighborhoods), your pricing, availability, and any local nuances. The AI can discuss Bowling Green-specific details like WKU schedules, Corvette plant shifts, or automotive industry schedules."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the AI gets a call it can't handle?",
      "answer": "Our AI successfully handles 85-95% of calls completely. For truly complex situations or emergencies you define, the AI seamlessly transfers the caller to you with a summary of the conversation. You maintain complete control over which situations require your immediate attention. Bowling Green businesses appreciate only being interrupted for important calls."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can a Bowling Green business get started?",
      "answer": "Most Bowling Green businesses go live within 48 hours of our initial consultation. We handle all technical setup, AI training, phone system integration, and calendar connections. You'll review the AI's responses and behavior before launch to ensure it perfectly represents your brand to Bowling Green customers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it work with our current Bowling Green phone number?",
      "answer": "Yes! We integrate with your existing phone system and number. Your Bowling Green customers call the same number they always have - they just experience better service with instant answers and 24/7 availability. No need to change your marketing materials or notify customers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if we're not satisfied?",
      "answer": "We offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee for Bowling Green businesses. If you're not capturing more leads and saving time, we'll refund your setup costs. However, most clients see measurable results within the first week. We're confident AI voice will transform how your Bowling Green business handles phone leads."
