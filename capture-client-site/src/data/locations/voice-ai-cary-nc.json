  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why do Cary businesses need Voice AI?",
      "answer": "Cary's competitive business environment means you can't afford to miss calls. When a potential customer calls and gets voicemail, they're calling your competitor next. Voice AI ensures every Cary caller gets immediate, professional attention - capturing leads your competitors miss."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Voice AI handle Cary-specific questions?",
      "answer": "We train your AI with detailed Cary information including service areas (Green Hope, Preston, Regency, etc.), local competitors, directions, and market-specific knowledge. The AI represents your Cary business as a knowledgeable local expert."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Voice AI integrate with our existing systems?",
      "answer": "Yes! We integrate with popular CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook), and other business software. For Cary businesses with custom systems, we offer API integration capabilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens during peak call times?",
      "answer": "Voice AI handles unlimited simultaneous calls, so during busy periods every Cary caller gets immediate attention. No more hold times, no more voicemail - just instant, professional service even when call volume spikes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does Voice AI cost?",
      "answer": "Our Cary packages start at $997/month including unlimited calls, custom training, calendar integration, analytics, and support. Most businesses find this costs less than a part-time employee while providing 24/7 coverage and better lead capture."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we try Voice AI before committing?",
      "answer": "Yes! We offer demos where you can call and interact with Voice AI. We can also provide Cary business case studies and discuss trial options during your free consultation."
