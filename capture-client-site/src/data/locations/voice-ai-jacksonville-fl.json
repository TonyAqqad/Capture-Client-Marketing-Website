    "paragraph": "From the growing logistics companies at the Port of Jacksonville to the financial firms in Downtown's Northbank district and the thriving businesses along the Beaches Town Center, Jacksonville business owners know that every call counts. Whether you're running an HVAC company in Mandarin, a law practice near the Independent Life Building, a real estate office in Ponte Vedra Beach, or a home services business in Orange Park, missed calls mean lost revenue. As Florida's largest city by land area, Jacksonville's sprawling market demands 24/7 availability—and Capture Client's Voice AI technology delivers."
