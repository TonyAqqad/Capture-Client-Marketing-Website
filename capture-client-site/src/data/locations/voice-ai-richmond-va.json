      "question": "What types of Richmond businesses benefit from Voice AI?",
      "answer": "Service businesses across Richmond see the biggest impact—HVAC companies, law firms, medical practices, home services (plumbing, electrical, roofing), real estate agents, and any Richmond business that gets phone leads. If you're missing calls or spending too much time on unqualified leads, Voice AI is perfect for you."

    {
      "question": "Can the AI handle Richmond-specific questions?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if the AI can't answer a question?",
      "answer": "If the AI encounters a question it can't answer confidently, it will capture the caller's information and either transfer the call to you immediately (if you're available) or schedule a callback at a convenient time. You never lose a lead."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can we get Voice AI set up?",
      "answer": "Most Richmond businesses are up and running within 1-2 weeks. We handle all the technical setup, AI training, and integration with your existing systems. You'll be capturing more leads before the month is out."
