  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why do Memphis businesses need Voice AI?",
      "answer": "Memphis has a 24/7 economy with logistics, healthcare, hospitality, and service industries running around the clock. Voice AI ensures you never miss a call regardless of time or call volume. In Memphis's competitive market, the businesses that respond fastest win the customer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Voice AI integrate with my Memphis business software?",
      "answer": "Yes! We integrate with popular CRMs (like Salesforce, HubSpot), scheduling tools (Calendly, Acuity), payment systems, and industry-specific software. If your Memphis business uses custom software, we can build API integrations to connect everything seamlessly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if the AI can't answer a question?",
      "answer": "Your Voice AI is trained to recognize when it needs human assistance. It will smoothly transfer the call to your team with full context of the conversation. You can also set up escalation rules for VIP Memphis customers or specific types of inquiries."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Voice AI suitable for small Memphis businesses?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Our pricing starts at $997/month with unlimited calls - often less than hiring part-time reception staff. Small Memphis businesses benefit the most because Voice AI gives you enterprise-level capabilities on a small business budget."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do Memphis customers react to Voice AI?",
      "answer": "Modern voice AI sounds natural and conversational. Most callers don't realize they're talking to AI - they just appreciate getting instant answers and being able to book appointments immediately. Customer satisfaction typically increases because wait times disappear."
