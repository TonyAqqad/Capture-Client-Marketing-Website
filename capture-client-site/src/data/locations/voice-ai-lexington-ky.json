  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does Voice AI work for Lexington businesses?",
      "answer": "Our AI voice agents function as your virtual receptionist, answering calls 24/7 with the knowledge and professionalism of a trained Lexington employee. The AI can discuss your services, answer common questions, qualify leads based on your criteria, book appointments, and transfer urgent calls when needed. It's trained specifically on your business and the Lexington market."
    },
    {
      "question": "What Lexington industries benefit most from Voice AI?",
      "answer": "We serve service-based businesses across Lexington including home services (HVAC, plumbing, electrical), medical and dental practices, legal services, real estate, equine services, contractors, and any business that relies on phone leads. If you're in Lexington or serve Fayette County and get phone inquiries, Voice AI can help you capture more leads."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the investment for Lexington businesses?",
      "answer": "Plans start at $997/month with no setup fees, including unlimited calls and ongoing optimization. Most Lexington businesses achieve ROI within 30 days. Consider that a single missed lead could be worth $5,000-$50,000 depending on your industry. Compare our pricing to hiring a receptionist at $35,000+ annually, plus benefits, training, and management time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the AI understand Lexington-specific needs?",
      "answer": "Yes! We train your AI on your specific service offerings, the Lexington areas you serve (downtown, Hamburg, Beaumont, Chevy Chase, or all of Fayette County), local nuances, and your business processes. It can even discuss Lexington-specific topics like Derby prep, horse farm services, or UK game day scheduling adjustments."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does call routing work?",
      "answer": "You decide the rules. The AI can handle routine calls completely, transfer urgent matters immediately, or take detailed messages for you to review. Most Lexington businesses configure their AI to handle 90% of calls independently, only transferring true emergencies or highly complex situations. This frees you to focus on revenue-generating activities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if our call volume is unpredictable?",
      "answer": "That's where AI shines. Whether you get 5 calls or 500 calls per day, the quality and speed of response stays consistent. Lexington businesses with seasonal fluctuations (like HVAC companies) love that they don't need to hire and train seasonal staff. The AI scales instantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does implementation take in Lexington?",
      "answer": "Most Lexington businesses are fully operational within 48 hours. We schedule a strategy call, build and train your AI, integrate with your phone and calendar systems, and launch. You review everything before we go live to ensure it represents your brand perfectly. No lengthy contracts or complicated implementations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of support do Lexington clients receive?",
      "answer": "Every client gets dedicated support via phone, email, and text. We monitor your AI's performance, provide monthly analytics reports, and make optimization recommendations. Think of us as an extension of your Lexington team. Our average client response time is under 2 hours during business hours."
