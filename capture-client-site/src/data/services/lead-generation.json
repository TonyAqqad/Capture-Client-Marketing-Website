    "paragraph": "Running a small business means you need a constant stream of qualified leads to grow. But effective lead generation is time-consuming, expensive, and requires expertise most small business owners don't have. DIY marketing wastes money on unqualified clicks. Hiring an in-house team is too expensive. That's where Capture Client's Lead Generation Services come in. We've driven over $10 million in revenue and generated 25,000+ qualified leads for businesses like yours. Our proven multi-channel approach combines expert Google Ads management, Facebook Ads strategy, AI-powered lead qualification, and conversion-optimized landing pages to deliver appointment-ready prospects. Our team handles everything—keyword research, ad creation, audience targeting, budget optimization, A/B testing, and continuous refinement. You get a predictable flow of qualified prospects without lifting a finger. We specialize in service-based businesses (HVAC, plumbing, legal, medical, home services, B2B) and understand exactly how to attract high-intent customers. Our clients see 3-5x ROI within 90 days with conversion rates averaging 15-25% from click to booked appointment. Unlike traditional agencies that charge hourly or take a percentage, we offer transparent monthly pricing with full campaign ownership and real-time dashboards. Track every lead, every dollar spent, and every conversion. Whether you need 10 leads or 1,000 per month, our proven system scales with your business. Stop guessing with your marketing budget.

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much do I need to spend on ads?",
      "answer": "Ad budgets vary based on your industry, location, and competition. Most of our clients invest between $1,000-$5,000 per month in ad spend, plus our management fee. We'll recommend a budget during your strategy call based on your goals and market. Our data shows that businesses investing $2,500+ monthly see the best ROI, with most achieving 3-5x return within 90 days."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Google Ads and Facebook Ads?",
      "answer": "Google Ads targets people actively searching for your services (high intent), resulting in 3-5x higher conversion rates. Facebook Ads targets people based on interests and demographics (awareness and nurturing), perfect for building your pipeline. We typically recommend both for maximum reach and conversions. Google captures ready-to-buy customers, while Facebook builds brand awareness and nurtures prospects."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many leads can I expect?",
      "answer": "Lead volume depends on your budget, industry, location, and competition. Most clients see 20-100 qualified leads per month with a $2,000-$5,000 ad spend. Our average client generates 50+ leads monthly. We'll provide detailed projections during your strategy call based on market data specific to your industry."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you create the ads and landing pages?",
      "answer": "Yes! Our team handles everything—ad copy, creative design, landing page development, and conversion optimization. You approve the strategy and messaging, we execute everything. All landing pages are mobile-optimized, fast-loading, and designed to convert at 15-25% or higher."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to see results?",
      "answer": "Most campaigns start generating leads within 7-14 days. Optimal performance typically develops over 30-60 days as we gather data and continuously optimize targeting, messaging, and bidding. Our fastest client generated 15 qualified leads in the first week. We recommend a 90-day commitment for best results."
    },
    {
      "question": "What industries do you specialize in?",
      "answer": "We specialize in service-based businesses including HVAC, plumbing, electrical, legal services, medical/dental practices, home services, real estate, financial services, and B2B professional services. We've generated over 25,000 leads across 15+ industries. If you serve local or B2B customers, we can help."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I cancel anytime?",
      "answer": "Yes. We offer month-to-month contracts with 30 days notice. No long-term commitments required. However, we recommend at least 90 days to allow proper optimization and data gathering for maximum ROI."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide the ad spend or do I?",
      "answer": "You provide the ad spend budget. Google and Facebook bill you directly for ad costs, giving you full transparency and control. We manage the campaigns and charge a separate management fee for our services. This ensures you own your campaigns and data completely."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of ROI can I expect from lead generation?",
      "answer": "Our average client sees 3-5x ROI within 90 days. For example, if you invest $3,000/month in ads plus our management fee, you should expect $9,000-$15,000+ in revenue. Many clients achieve 400%+ ROI as campaigns mature. We provide monthly reports showing exact cost per lead, conversion rates, and revenue attribution."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure lead quality?",
      "answer": "We use advanced audience targeting, negative keyword filtering, lead scoring, and AI-powered qualification to ensure only high-intent prospects reach you. Our multi-step qualification process includes demographic targeting, behavioral signals, and automated follow-up. Average lead-to-customer conversion rate is 15-25%, significantly higher than industry standards."
