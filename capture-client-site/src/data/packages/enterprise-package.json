    {
      "question": "How is Enterprise different from Growth?",
      "answer": "Enterprise includes: unlimited calls and AI agents, BOTH Google and Facebook ads (vs choosing one), custom landing pages (vs optimization only), dedicated account manager, 24/7 support, and real-time reporting dashboard. It's built for businesses that need white-glove service and maximum lead generation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you require a long-term contract?",
      "answer": "While we prefer 6-month commitments to allow time for optimization, we don't require multi-year contracts. Most enterprise clients stay long-term because the ROI is strong."

    {
      "question": "Can you handle multiple locations?",

      "question": "What industries do you work with?",
