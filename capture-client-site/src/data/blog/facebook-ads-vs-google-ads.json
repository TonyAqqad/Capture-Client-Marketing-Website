  "excerpt": "Stuck choosing between Facebook and Google Ads? I'll show you the real differences, what they cost, and which platform fits your business goals (spoiler: it's not one-size-fits-all).",
  "content": "<p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Last week, I talked to a plumber in Nashville who'd just blown through $2,000 on Facebook Ads with nothing to show for it. The week before? A salon owner who couldn't figure out why her Google Ads weren't working.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Here's the thing: both of them were using the <em class=\"text-accent\">wrong platform</em> for what they were trying to accomplish.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If you're a small business owner staring at your marketing budget wondering whether to bet on Facebook or Google, you're asking the right question. But the answer isn't as simple as \"Facebook is better\" or \"Google wins.\"</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">I'm going to break down exactly how these platforms work, what they actually cost, and most importantly—which one makes sense for <em class=\"text-accent\">your</em> specific business. No fluff, no jargon, just practical advice you can use today.</p></div><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6\">The Core Difference (And Why It Matters)</h2><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Before we dive into costs and features, you need to understand the fundamental difference between these platforms. It's the difference between hunting and fishing.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Google Ads is hunting.</strong> People are actively searching for what you offer. Someone types \"emergency plumber near me\" at 11 PM—they've got a problem <em class=\"text-accent\">right now</em>. You show up with the solution, they click, you (hopefully) get a customer.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Facebook Ads is fishing.</strong> People are scrolling through their feed looking at vacation photos and cat videos. You're interrupting them with something they didn't know they wanted. Your job is to make them stop, think \"huh, that's actually interesting,\" and click.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Neither approach is better—they're just different. And that difference determines everything else.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6\">Let's Talk Money: What These Actually Cost</h2><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">I'm going to be straight with you: the \"average cost\" numbers you see online are basically useless. A Facebook ad for a local coffee shop costs way less than one for a law firm.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">But here's what I've seen work for real small businesses:</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Google Ads Costs</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">According to WordStream's 2024 data, the average cost-per-click across all industries is $2.69. But that's misleading because it varies wildly:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-gray-300\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Service businesses</strong> (plumbers, electricians, HVAC): $5-$50 per click</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Local retail/restaurants</strong>: $1-$3 per click</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Professional services</strong> (accountants, lawyers): $6-$100+ per click</li></ul><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">I know what you're thinking: \"$50 per click?! That's insane!\"</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Here's the math that makes it work: If you're a plumber charging $150 for a service call, and 1 in 10 clicks becomes a customer, you're spending $500 to make $150. That's terrible, right?</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Wrong. Because that customer calls you again when their water heater breaks. And they refer you to their neighbor. Your actual customer lifetime value might be $2,000+. Suddenly $50 per click looks pretty reasonable.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Facebook Ads Costs</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Facebook is generally cheaper per click—usually $0.50 to $2.00 for most small businesses. But (and this is a big but), you need way more clicks to get the same results.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Why? Because people on Facebook aren't actively looking for your service. You're creating demand, not capturing it. That takes more touches, more convincing, more clicks before someone converts.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Here's what I typically see:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-gray-300\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Local awareness campaigns</strong>: $0.50-$1.50 per click</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Lead generation</strong>: $5-$15 per lead</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Direct sales</strong>: $2-$5 per click (but lower conversion rates)</li></ul><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">The salon owner I mentioned earlier? She was getting clicks at $0.75 each. Sounds great, right? Except her conversion rate was under 1% because people weren't ready to book—they were just curious.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6\">Audience Targeting: Apples vs Oranges</h2><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">This is where things get interesting.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Google's Approach: Intent-Based</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">With Google Ads, you're targeting <em class=\"text-accent\">what people are searching for</em>. Someone types \"best pizza delivery near me\" and boom—your ad can show up.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">You can target by:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-gray-300\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Specific search terms (keywords)</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Location (down to a specific radius)</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Time of day</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Device type</li></ul><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">The beautiful thing? You <em class=\"text-accent\">know</em> they're interested. They literally just told Google they want pizza.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Facebook's Approach: Interest-Based</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Facebook lets you target people based on who they are and what they like:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-gray-300\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Demographics (age, gender, income level)</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Interests (what pages they follow, what they engage with)</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Behaviors (purchase history, device usage)</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Life events (just moved, recently engaged, new parent)</li></ul><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">I once helped a children's party entertainment company target parents within 10 miles who had kids ages 4-8 and had engaged with birthday-related content in the past month. We got leads at $8 each. Try doing <em class=\"text-accent\">that</em> with Google.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6\">When Google Ads Actually Makes Sense</h2><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Google works best when people are actively looking for what you offer. Here are the scenarios where I'd choose Google first:</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">1. Emergency or Urgent Services</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If you're a locksmith, tow truck, emergency plumber, or urgent care clinic—Google is your friend. When someone's locked out of their house at midnight, they're not scrolling Facebook. They're frantically Googling.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">2. High-Intent Services</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">When people search \"divorce lawyer near me\" or \"roof replacement cost,\" they're not window shopping. They've got a need, and they're comparing options.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">One roofing contractor I worked with was spending $40 per click on Google. Sounds expensive until you realize his average job was $8,000 and his close rate from Google leads was 15%. Do the math—that's profitable.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">3. Specific Product Searches</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If you sell something people actively search for—\"custom wedding invitations,\" \"organic dog food delivery,\" \"used iPhone 13\"—Google captures that intent beautifully.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6\">When Facebook Ads Actually Makes Sense</h2><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Facebook shines when you need to create awareness, build relationships, or reach people who don't know they need you yet.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">1. Visual Products or Services</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If your work looks good in photos or videos—think restaurants, salons, home services, retail—Facebook's visual format is perfect.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">That salon owner? Once we switched her to Facebook with before/after photos and client testimonials, her lead cost dropped to $12 per booking. Way better than the Google Search ads she was trying to run.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">2. Longer Sales Cycles</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If you're selling something people don't buy on impulse—like fitness training, home remodeling, or financial planning—Facebook lets you nurture the relationship over time.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">You can show them multiple ads, build trust, tell your story. By the time they're ready to buy, you're the obvious choice.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">3. Local Awareness</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Opening a new location? Announcing a special event? Facebook's local awareness ads are incredibly effective and cheap.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">I've seen local businesses reach 5,000+ people in their neighborhood for under $50. You can't do that efficiently with Google.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6\">Industry-Specific Recommendations</h2><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Let me get really specific because that's what actually helps:</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Restaurants & Food Services</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Winner: Facebook</strong></p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">People don't usually Google \"where should I eat tonight\" anymore—they scroll Instagram or ask friends. Use Facebook/Instagram ads with drool-worthy food photos, special offers, and location targeting.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Home Services (Plumbing, HVAC, Electrical)</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Winner: Google</strong></p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">These are almost always emergency or high-intent purchases. When someone's AC breaks in July, they're Googling, not checking Facebook.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Professional Services (Accountants, Lawyers, Consultants)</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Winner: Google, then Facebook retargeting</strong></p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Start with Google to capture the high-intent searches, then use Facebook to retarget people who visited your site but didn't convert. This one-two punch is powerful.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Retail & E-commerce</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Winner: Both (seriously)</strong></p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Use Google Shopping ads to capture product searches, and Facebook for brand awareness and retargeting. Most successful e-commerce businesses use both platforms together.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Gyms & Fitness Studios</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Winner: Facebook</strong></p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">People don't wake up and Google \"gyms near me\" very often. But they scroll Facebook feeling guilty about skipping workouts. Hit them with transformation photos and limited-time offers when they're in that mindset.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6\">Can You Use Both? (Should You?)</h2><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Here's the truth: most successful small businesses <em class=\"text-accent\">eventually</em> use both platforms. But that doesn't mean you should start with both.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If you're just getting started with paid ads, pick one and master it first. Trying to do both with a limited budget is like spreading butter on too much bread—you end up with a thin, ineffective layer everywhere.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">My recommendation:</strong> Start with whichever platform matches your business type (see the industry recommendations above). Get profitable on one platform, then expand to the second as a growth channel.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Once you're established on both, here's how they work together beautifully:</p><ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-gray-300\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Google captures the demand</strong> from people actively searching</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Facebook retargets the visitors</strong> who didn't convert</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Facebook also builds brand awareness</strong> so more people search for you on Google</li></ol><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">It's a virtuous cycle, but you need enough budget to make both work. For most small businesses, that's at least $2,000-3,000/month across both platforms.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6\">The Real Decision Framework</h2><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Forget everything you just read for a second. Here are the only three questions you need to answer:</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Question 1: Are people actively searching for what you offer?</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If yes → Start with Google<br>If no → Start with Facebook</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Question 2: Is your product/service visual?</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If yes → Facebook has an advantage<br>If no → Google might be better</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Question 3: What's your budget?</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Under $500/month → Pick ONE platform and focus<br>$500-2,000/month → Master one, then test the other<br>Over $2,000/month → Use both strategically</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6\">What Nobody Tells You (But I Will)</h2><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Here are some hard truths from running thousands of dollars in ads for small businesses:</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">1. Your first campaigns will probably lose money.</strong> That's normal. You're paying for data. The businesses that succeed are the ones that stick with it long enough to optimize.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">2. The platform isn't your problem—your offer is.</strong> I've seen businesses fail on both platforms because their offer wasn't compelling. No amount of targeting fixes a mediocre offer.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">3. You need a real budget.</strong> Spending $10/day on Facebook or Google won't move the needle. You need at least $300-500/month to gather enough data to make informed decisions.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">4. Organic reach is dead.</strong> If you're waiting to \"build an audience organically\" before running ads, you'll be waiting forever. Paid advertising is no longer optional—it's table stakes.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6\">Common Mistakes I See All the Time</h2><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">The \"Set It and Forget It\" Approach</strong></p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Both platforms require active management. If you launch a campaign and check back in two weeks, you've wasted money. Check performance daily, especially in the first week.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Targeting Too Broad on Facebook</strong></p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Targeting \"everyone in my city\" rarely works. Get specific. That party entertainment company I mentioned? They went from targeting all parents to targeting parents of kids 4-8 with birthdays in the next 60 days. Costs dropped by 60%.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Using Only Brand Terms on Google</strong></p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If you're only bidding on your business name, you're missing the whole point. People searching your name already know about you. Bid on problem-based keywords your customers are actually searching.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Sending Traffic to Your Homepage</strong></p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">This kills me. You're paying $3 per click to send someone to a generic homepage? Create dedicated landing pages for each campaign with one clear call-to-action.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Which platform is easier for beginners?</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Facebook is generally more user-friendly for beginners. The Ads Manager interface is more intuitive, and you can start with a simple \"Boost Post\" to learn the basics. Google Ads has a steeper learning curve, but the quality of traffic is often higher.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">How long before I see results?</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">On Google, you can see clicks within hours of launching. But profitable results? Give it 2-4 weeks to gather data and optimize. Facebook often takes longer—4-6 weeks—because you're building awareness, not just capturing existing demand. Don't pull the plug too early.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">Can I run ads without a website?</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Facebook allows you to run ads that go directly to Messenger, your Facebook page, or even a phone number. Google Ads technically requires a landing page, but it doesn't have to be a full website—a simple landing page works fine. That said, you'll get better results with a proper website.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4\">What if I'm in a super competitive industry?</h3><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">High competition usually means higher costs, but it also means there's demand. Focus on hyper-local targeting and specific niches. Instead of \"personal injury lawyer,\" try \"car accident lawyer in [specific neighborhood].\" Get more specific than your competitors are willing to go.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6\">My Honest Recommendation</h2><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If you've made it this far, you're serious about making paid advertising work. So here's what I'd actually do if I were in your shoes:</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Month 1-2:</strong> Pick ONE platform based on your business type (use my industry recommendations above). Commit to a real budget—at least $500/month. Learn the platform, test different audiences and ads, and track everything.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Month 3-4:</strong> Double down on what's working. By now you should have clear data on which ads, audiences, and offers are performing. Cut the losers, scale the winners.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-white font-semibold\">Month 5-6:</strong> If you're profitable on the first platform, start testing the second one with 20-30% of your budget. Don't abandon what's working—add to it.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Most small businesses that fail with paid ads fail because they try to do too much, too fast, with too little budget. Pick one, master it, then expand.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6\">Ready to Stop Guessing?</h2><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Look, I get it. Paid advertising feels risky when you're spending your own money. You want guarantees, but there aren't any.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">What I <em class=\"text-accent\">can</em> promise is this: businesses that don't invest in paid advertising get left behind. Your competitors are already on Google and Facebook. The question isn't whether to do it—it's how to do it smarter than them.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">At Capture Client, we've spent years testing what actually works for small businesses like yours. We don't sell you both platforms just to increase our fees—we recommend the platform that matches your specific business model and budget.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Want us to take a look at your business and give you an honest recommendation? <a class=\"text-accent hover:text-accent/80 underline\" href='/contact'>Book a free 30-minute strategy call</a>. We'll tell you exactly which platform makes sense for you, what budget you need, and what kind of results you can realistically expect.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">No pressure, no sales pitch—just straight advice from people who've been in the trenches.</p><p class=\"text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Because at the end of the day, the best advertising platform is the one that actually brings you customers. Everything else is just noise.</p>",
