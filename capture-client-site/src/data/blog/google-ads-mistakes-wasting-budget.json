  "content": "<p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Last week, I sat down with Sarah, a plumbing company owner who'd spent $4,200 on Google Ads over three months. Her result? Exactly two phone calls. Neither became customers.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">\"I thought Google Ads were supposed to work,\" she told me, frustration evident in her voice. \"I'm basically just donating money to Google at this point.\"</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Here's the thing: Google Ads <em class=\"text-accent\">do</em> work. But not when you're making these five critical mistakes that I see small business owners make over and over again.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">I've audited hundreds of Google Ads accounts for small businesses, and I can tell you right now—if your ads aren't working, it's probably not Google's fault. You're likely doing at least one (or all) of these budget-killing mistakes.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Let me show you what's going wrong and how to fix it.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6\">Mistake #1: You're Using Broad Match Keywords Like They're Confetti</h2><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">This is the big one. The budget killer. The reason Sarah was getting clicks from people searching \"how to unclog a drain with baking soda\" instead of \"emergency plumber near me.\"</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">When you use broad match keywords in Google Ads, you're basically telling Google, \"Hey, show my ad for anything you think is kinda related to this word.\" And Google will take you up on that offer—enthusiastically.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">Why This Hurts Your Results</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Let's say you bid on the broad match keyword \"plumber.\" You think you're reaching people who need a plumber, right?</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Wrong. Google might show your ad for:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-600\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">\"plumber salary\" (job seekers, not customers)</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">\"plumber meme\" (people looking for laughs, not leaks)</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">\"plumber's crack\" (do I even need to explain?)</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">\"Mario the plumber\" (video game fans)</li></ul><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">You're paying for every single one of those clicks. And none of them are calling you for business.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">According to WordStream's 2024 industry benchmarks, businesses using broad match keywords waste an average of 76% of their ad spend on irrelevant clicks. That's three out of every four dollars going down the drain.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">How to Fix It</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Switch to phrase match or exact match keywords. Here's what that looks like:</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">Broad match:</strong> plumber<br><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">Phrase match:</strong> \"emergency plumber\"<br><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">Exact match:</strong> [emergency plumber near me]</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Phrase match gives you some flexibility while keeping you relevant. Exact match is ultra-specific but can limit your reach. I usually recommend starting with phrase match and using exact match for your highest-performing keywords.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Also, and this is crucial: <strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">add negative keywords</strong>. These tell Google what searches you DON'T want to show up for.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">For Sarah's plumbing business, I added negative keywords like: salary, jobs, career, DIY, how to, Mario, meme, and video. Her irrelevant clicks dropped by 81% in the first week.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6\">Mistake #2: You're Sending Everyone to Your Homepage</h2><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">I get it. Your homepage is beautiful. You spent good money on it. But it's not a landing page, and that's costing you conversions.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">When someone clicks your ad for \"emergency water heater repair,\" they don't want to land on your homepage with its generic \"Welcome to Joe's Plumbing!\" headline. They want to see a page about emergency water heater repair—immediately.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">Why This Hurts Your Results</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Think about how you shop online. You click an ad for \"men's running shoes size 11,\" and you land on the homepage of a sporting goods store. What do you do?</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If you're like 73% of people (according to a 2024 Unbounce study), you bounce. You hit the back button and try the next result.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Every bounce is money wasted. You paid for that click, and the person left without even considering your service.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Google also tracks your bounce rate and uses it to determine your Quality Score. High bounce rate = low Quality Score = higher costs per click = more wasted budget. It's a vicious cycle.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">How to Fix It</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Create dedicated landing pages for each service you're advertising. If you're running ads for emergency plumbing, water heater repair, and drain cleaning, you need three landing pages.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Each landing page should:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-600\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Match the headline of your ad (if your ad says \"24/7 Emergency Plumber,\" your landing page headline should too)</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Have ONE clear call-to-action (usually a phone number or form)</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Remove navigation menus that distract people from converting</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Include trust signals like reviews, years in business, and guarantees</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Load fast (under 3 seconds or people bounce)</li></ul><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">When I helped Sarah create service-specific landing pages, her conversion rate jumped from 0.6% to 8.2%. Same budget, 13x more customers.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6\">Mistake #3: You're Not Tracking Conversions (So You're Flying Blind)</h2><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">This one blows my mind every time I see it, but it's shockingly common. I've audited accounts spending $5,000+ per month with zero conversion tracking set up.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">That's like driving cross-country with a blindfold on. Sure, you might eventually get somewhere, but you'll crash a lot and waste a ton of gas along the way.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">Why This Hurts Your Results</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Without conversion tracking, you don't know:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-600\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Which keywords are bringing you customers (vs. tire kickers)</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Which ads are actually generating phone calls</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">What time of day your best leads come in</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Whether your budget is going to the right campaigns</li></ul><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">You're making decisions based on gut feeling instead of data. And I can promise you, your gut is wrong more often than it's right.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Google's own data shows that advertisers who track conversions see a 30% higher ROI than those who don't. Why? Because they can optimize what's working and kill what isn't.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">How to Fix It</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Set up conversion tracking today. Not tomorrow. Today.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Here's what you need to track:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-600\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">Phone calls:</strong> Use Google's call tracking or a service like CallRail</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">Form submissions:</strong> Track contact form completions as conversions</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">Live chat initiations:</strong> If you have chat on your site, track it</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">Direction requests:</strong> For local businesses, people clicking for directions is valuable</li></ul><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Once tracking is set up, you'll start seeing which keywords actually make your phone ring. Then you can shift budget from the duds to the winners.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Fair warning: setting up conversion tracking can be technical. If you're not comfortable with Google Tag Manager and tracking pixels, hire someone to do it right. It's worth every penny.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6\">Mistake #4: You're Ignoring Your Search Terms Report</h2><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Your Search Terms Report is like a treasure map that shows you exactly where people are finding you. And most business owners never even look at it.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">This report shows you the actual phrases people typed into Google before clicking your ad. It's different from your keyword list—it's reality vs. your assumptions.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">Why This Hurts Your Results</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">When I pulled Sarah's Search Terms Report, here's what I found:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-600\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">\"plumber salary in Tennessee\" - 47 clicks, $94 wasted</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">\"how to become a licensed plumber\" - 23 clicks, $51 wasted</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">\"plumber game online free\" - 18 clicks, $36 wasted</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">\"plumber job openings\" - 31 clicks, $68 wasted</li></ul><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">That's $249 in one month on searches that had ZERO chance of becoming customers. Over a year, that's $2,988 straight into the garbage.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">And these are just the obvious ones. There were dozens more that were less obviously wrong but still unlikely to convert.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">How to Fix It</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Check your Search Terms Report every week. Here's how:</p><ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-600\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Log into Google Ads</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Click on a campaign</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Click \"Keywords\" in the left menu</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Click \"Search Terms\" at the top</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Look for irrelevant searches getting clicks</li></ol><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">When you find irrelevant terms, add them as negative keywords immediately. Be ruthless about this.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">I also look for opportunities. Sometimes you'll see search terms you didn't think to bid on that are converting well. Add those as new keywords!</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">This 15-minute weekly habit has saved my clients tens of thousands of dollars. It's the highest-ROI activity you can do in your Google Ads account.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6\">Mistake #5: You're Competing on Price Instead of Value</h2><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">\"Cheapest plumber in Nashville!\"<br>\"Lowest prices guaranteed!\"<br>\"We'll beat any competitor's quote!\"</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If this is how you're positioning yourself in your ads, you're training customers to shop on price alone. And you can't win that game.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">Why This Hurts Your Results</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">When you compete on price, you attract price shoppers. These are the people who:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-600\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Call 10 different companies looking for quotes</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Never actually book (they're \"just getting prices\")</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Take forever to make a decision</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Complain about every charge</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Leave bad reviews if you're not the absolute cheapest</li></ul><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Plus, there's always someone willing to go cheaper than you. Someone less experienced, less insured, less qualified. You don't want to compete with them.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">According to a 2024 study by Duct Tape Marketing, small businesses that compete on value instead of price have a 54% higher customer lifetime value and 38% better profit margins.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">How to Fix It</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Shift your messaging to focus on value, not price. Talk about:</p><ul class=\"list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-600\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">Speed:</strong> \"Same-day emergency service\" beats \"cheap plumber\"</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">Reliability:</strong> \"20+ years in business, A+ BBB rating\"</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">Guarantee:</strong> \"100% satisfaction guarantee or your money back\"</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">Expertise:</strong> \"Licensed, bonded, and certified in all 50 plumbing specialties\"</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\"><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">Results:</strong> \"Fixed right the first time—98% first-visit resolution rate\"</li></ul><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">When Sarah changed her ad copy from \"Affordable plumbing services\" to \"24/7 emergency plumber—licensed, guaranteed, same-day service,\" her cost per lead dropped by 42%. Why? Because she was attracting serious buyers instead of price shoppers.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Yes, you'll get fewer clicks. But the clicks you get will be WAY more likely to convert into paying customers.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6\">How to Fix All Five Mistakes (Your Action Plan)</h2><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">I know that's a lot. If you're feeling overwhelmed, here's what I'd do if I were you:</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">This week:</strong></p><ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-600\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Set up conversion tracking (or hire someone to do it)</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Check your Search Terms Report and add negative keywords</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Change at least one keyword from broad to phrase match</li></ol><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">This month:</strong></p><ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-600\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Create a dedicated landing page for your top service</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Rewrite your ad copy to focus on value, not price</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Set a weekly reminder to review your Search Terms Report</li></ol><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\"><strong class=\"text-slate-900 font-semibold\">This quarter:</strong></p><ol class=\"list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-600\"><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Create landing pages for all your major services</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Build a comprehensive negative keyword list</li><li class=\"leading-relaxed\">Test different value propositions in your ads</li></ol><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">You don't have to do everything at once. But you do need to start. Every day you're running ads with these mistakes is another day you're handing Google money you could be keeping as profit.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">How much should I spend on Google Ads as a small business?</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">It depends on your industry and goals, but I generally recommend starting with at least $1,000-$1,500 per month. Anything less and you won't get enough data to optimize effectively. That said, I've seen businesses succeed with as little as $500/month if they're in a less competitive market and have their targeting dialed in perfectly.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">The better question is: what's a customer worth to you? If your average customer is worth $2,000 and you can get customers for $100 each through Google Ads, you'd want to spend as much as possible!</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">Should I hire someone to manage my Google Ads or do it myself?</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Honest answer? If you're spending under $2,000/month, try doing it yourself first (while avoiding these five mistakes). Use the money you'd pay an agency to test and learn.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If you're spending $2,000-$5,000/month, consider hiring a freelance specialist. The right person will pay for themselves in savings and improved results.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If you're spending $5,000+/month, hire a professional agency or full-time person. At that spend level, amateur mistakes cost you thousands per month.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">How long does it take to see results from Google Ads?</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">You should see <em class=\"text-accent\">clicks</em> within hours of launching your first campaign. But meaningful results? Give it 4-6 weeks.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Here's why: you need time to gather data, identify what's working, and optimize. In week one, you're learning. By week four, you're improving. By week eight, you should have a profitable campaign (if Google Ads is right for your business).</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If you're not seeing any positive results after 8 weeks, something's fundamentally wrong with either your strategy or your business's fit for Google Ads.</p><h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4\">What's a good conversion rate for Google Ads?</h3><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">For service businesses, I like to see 5-10% conversion rates on dedicated landing pages. If you're below 3%, something's broken (usually one of the five mistakes I mentioned).</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">But here's the thing: conversion rate doesn't matter as much as cost per acquisition. If you're getting a 2% conversion rate but each customer is worth $5,000 and costs you $100 to acquire, you've got a gold mine. If you're getting 15% conversion rate but each lead costs $500 and customers are only worth $300, you're losing money.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Focus on the economics, not just the percentages.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6\">Stop Wasting Money on Google Ads That Don't Work</h2><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Look, I'm not going to tell you that fixing these five mistakes will magically make you rich overnight. Google Ads is still competitive, still complex, and still requires ongoing optimization.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">But I can tell you this: every single client I've worked with who fixed these mistakes saw immediate improvement. Usually within the first two weeks.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Sarah, the plumber I told you about at the beginning? After we fixed her broad match keywords, created service-specific landing pages, set up conversion tracking, cleaned up her search terms, and shifted to value-based messaging, her results completely changed.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Three months later, she'd spent $3,800 on ads and generated 47 qualified leads. She closed 19 of them. Her average job value was $850, meaning she made $16,150 in revenue from $3,800 in ad spend.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">That's a 325% return. Not bad for fixing five mistakes.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">If your Google Ads aren't working, don't give up. Just stop making these mistakes.</p><p class=\"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6\">Need help auditing your Google Ads account to find (and fix) these budget-killing mistakes? <a class=\"text-accent hover:text-accent/80 underline\" href=\"/contact\">Get a free account audit from our team</a>.
