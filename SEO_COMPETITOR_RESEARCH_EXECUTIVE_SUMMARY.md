**Expected Impact**:

- Pricing displays in search results
- Software comparison rich results
- Improved AI Overview citations (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI)

**Competitors analyzed**: Lindy.ai, Bland.ai, Voiceflow, Smith.ai, Synthflow, Retell AI, Rosie AI, Slang.ai, Goodcall, CallHippo
**Competitors with SoftwareApplication schema**: 0/10

### 2. Entity SEO & Knowledge Graph Optimization
**Market Shift**: Google now prioritizes "semantic authority" over traditional backlink profiles

**Key Stats**:
- Knowledge panels get 38% CTR vs. 28% for position #1
- Pages with proper entity markup get 30% more impressions
- 88.1% of AI Overview queries prioritize informational content depth

**Current Capture Client Status**: Basic Organization schema ✅, but missing enhanced entity signals

**Enhancement Needed**: Add `knowsAbout`, `sameAs`, and `subjectOf` properties to establish semantic authority in Voice AI domain

### 3. Voice Search Explosion

- 83% replaced by AI Overviews
- **BUT**: AI Overviews cite the same high-quality sources
- Featured snippet pages still get 44% CTR vs. 19.6% for #1

**Strategy**: Optimize for both featured snippets AND AI Overview citations through:
