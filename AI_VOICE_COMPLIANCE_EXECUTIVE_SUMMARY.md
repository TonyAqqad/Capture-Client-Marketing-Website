# Executive Summary: AI Voice Calling Compliance
## 3-Minute Overview for Capture Client

**Date:** December 1, 2025
**Status:** Immediate Action Required

---

## The Bottom Line

**AI voice calling is HEAVILY REGULATED.** As of February 2024, the FCC classified AI-generated voices as "artificial" under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), making ALL AI calling subject to strict consent and disclosure requirements.

**Risk Level:** HIGH for outbound marketing calls | MEDIUM for inbound call handling

---

## What's Required RIGHT NOW (Effective Feb 2024)

### For Outbound Marketing Calls with AI:

1. **Prior Express WRITTEN Consent** (TCPA requirement)
   - Must get signed/electronic consent BEFORE calling
   - Must include specific phone number
   - Must state "consent not required for purchase"
   - **Penalty: $500-$1,500 PER CALL without consent**

2. **Do Not Call Registry Compliance**
   - Check DNC list before calling
   - Honor opt-out requests (STOP texts)

3. **No Deceptive Practices**
   - Don't use AI to mislead or defraud
   - Be transparent about AI use

### For Inbound Calls (AI Answering Phone):

**Current:** NOT covered by TCPA (lower risk)

**Best Practice:** Still disclose AI use for transparency

---

## What's Coming in 2025 (Proposed FCC Rules)

**Status:** Bipartisan support, likely to pass

### Additional Requirements (When Adopted):

1. **AI-Specific Consent Language**
   - Consent forms must explicitly mention "AI-generated calls"
   - Example: "I agree to receive calls using AI-generated voice technology"

2. **Beginning-of-Call Disclosure**
   - Must disclose AI use at START of every call
   - Example: "This call is using AI-generated voice technology"

3. **"Clear and Conspicuous" Disclosure**
   - Can't hide AI disclosure in fine print

## State Laws to Watch

- **Who:** Regulated industries (healthcare, legal, financial)
- **What:** Disclose AI when asked or in "high-risk" interactions
- **Risk:** LOW (narrow scope after 2025 amendment)

### Colorado (Effective February 2026)

### California (Multiple Laws, Effective 2025-2026)
- **Who:** "Companion chatbots" and large AI platforms
- **What:** Disclose if AI could be mistaken for human
- **Risk:** MEDIUM - be proactive about disclosure
