## Voice AI Agent Services

### Description of Services
Capture Client provides AI-powered voice assistant technology ("Voice AI Agents") to handle incoming customer calls for your business. Our Voice AI Agents use artificial intelligence and machine learning to engage with callers, answer questions, qualify leads, schedule appointments, and transfer calls to your team when necessary.

### AI Technology Disclosure
Our Voice AI Agents utilize artificial intelligence technology to generate human-like voice responses in real-time. While designed to provide accurate and helpful information, Voice AI Agents are not human employees. Your customers will be interacting with an AI-powered system when calling your business.

### Your Responsibilities

**Customer Disclosure:**
You agree to disclose to your customers that calls may be answered by an AI-powered assistant. We recommend including language on your website such as: "Calls may be answered by our AI assistant" or similar disclosure.

**Compliance with Telemarketing Laws:**
If you use Voice AI services for outbound calling or marketing purposes, you are solely responsible for:

1. Obtaining prior express written consent from call recipients as required by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and applicable state laws
2. Including clear disclosure in consent forms that calls may include AI-generated voice content
3. Complying with the National Do Not Call Registry requirements
4. Providing clear opt-out mechanisms (e.g., "Reply STOP to unsubscribe")
5. Honoring consent revocation requests immediately
6. Maintaining records of consent for at least four (4) years
7. Complying with all applicable federal, state, and local telemarketing regulations

**State-Specific Requirements:**
Additional disclosure and compliance requirements may apply under laws in Utah, Colorado, California, and other states. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable state laws governing AI-powered communications.

**Prohibited Uses:**
You may not use Voice AI services for:
- Fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading purposes
- Unauthorized impersonation or voice cloning
- Violation of any consumer protection law or regulation
- Making unsolicited calls to consumers who have not provided proper consent
- Any illegal purpose

### Regulatory Compliance
Our Voice AI technology complies with FCC regulations classifying AI-generated voices as "artificial or prerecorded voice" under the TCPA (effective February 2024). You acknowledge that Voice AI calls are subject to TCPA requirements including consent, disclosure, and opt-out provisions.

### Call Recording and Data Processing
Voice AI interactions may be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for quality assurance, training, compliance monitoring, and service improvement purposes. You are responsible for complying with applicable call recording consent laws in your jurisdiction and notifying your customers of recording as required by law.

### Changes to Regulatory Requirements
AI calling regulations are evolving. We will notify you of material changes to regulatory requirements affecting Voice AI services. You agree to cooperate in implementing necessary compliance updates.

### Limitation of Liability
You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your use of Voice AI services and any legal consequences arising from non-compliance with telemarketing laws, consumer protection regulations, or disclosure requirements.

## Artificial Intelligence and Voice Data Processing

### Use of AI Technology

**Voice AI Services:**
Capture Client uses artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and natural language processing technologies to provide Voice AI Agent services. Our AI systems process voice interactions to understand customer inquiries and generate appropriate spoken responses.

### Data Collected and Processed

**Voice Interaction Data:**
When Voice AI services are used to handle calls for your business, we collect and process:

- Voice recordings of customer calls
- Transcripts of conversations (speech-to-text)
- Caller phone numbers and metadata (call duration, timestamp, call outcome)
- Customer information provided during calls (names, email addresses, appointment details, service requests, etc.)
- AI performance data (call resolution rates, escalation frequency, customer satisfaction indicators)

### Purpose of Data Collection

We collect and process voice data to:
- Enable AI agents to respond accurately to customer inquiries
- Improve AI performance through machine learning
- Provide analytics and reporting to clients
- Ensure quality assurance and compliance monitoring
- Train and refine AI models
- Resolve disputes and support customer service escalations

### Data Storage and Retention

**Storage:**
Voice recordings and transcripts are stored securely using industry-standard encryption on cloud infrastructure.

**Retention Period:**
- Active call recordings: Retained for 90 days unless longer retention is requested by the client or required for legal compliance
- Anonymized training data: May be retained indefinitely to improve AI models
- Transcripts and analytics: Retained per client contract terms or until account termination + 30 days

**Deletion:**
Upon request or account termination, we will delete personal voice data in accordance with applicable law and our data retention policy.

### Data Security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect voice data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, including:
- Encryption in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest (AES-256)
- Role-based access controls limiting employee access
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- Incident response procedures

### Third-Party AI Services

Our Voice AI technology may utilize third-party services, including:
- Speech recognition and transcription services
- Natural language understanding engines
- Text-to-speech voice synthesis platforms
- Cloud computing and storage infrastructure

Third-party service providers are contractually obligated to maintain data security and comply with applicable privacy laws. We do not sell voice data to third parties.

### Call Recording Notice and Consent

**Two-Party Consent States:**
In states requiring two-party consent for call recording (e.g., California, Florida, Pennsylvania), our Voice AI agents provide notice that calls may be recorded. Clients are responsible for ensuring compliance with call recording laws in their jurisdiction.

**Client Responsibility:**
Clients using Voice AI services agree to comply with applicable call recording consent requirements and to notify their customers of recording where required by law.

### Your Rights

**Access:** You may request copies of voice recordings and transcripts related to your account.

**Deletion:** You may request deletion of voice data, subject to legal retention obligations.

**Opt-Out:** You may request that AI call handling be disabled and calls be routed to human agents only.

**Revocation of Consent:** If you previously consented to AI-powered marketing calls, you may revoke consent at any time by contacting us or replying "STOP" to text messages.

### State-Specific Privacy Rights

**California Residents (CCPA/CPRA):**
California residents have additional rights including:
- Right to know what personal information is collected
- Right to request deletion of personal information
- Right to opt out of "sale" or "sharing" of personal information (we do not sell voice data)
- Right to non-discrimination for exercising privacy rights
- Rights regarding automated decision-making and profiling

**Colorado, Virginia, Connecticut, and Utah Residents:**
Residents of these states have similar rights under their respective state privacy laws.

### AI-Specific Disclosures

**Algorithmic Decision-Making:**
Our Voice AI technology uses algorithms to determine appropriate responses to customer inquiries and route calls to human agents when necessary. These automated decisions do not have legal or similarly significant effects on consumers. Human oversight is available via call transfer to live agents.

**Bias and Fairness:**
We employ testing and monitoring to identify and mitigate bias in our AI systems. If you believe you were treated unfairly by our AI, please contact us.

### Children's Privacy

Voice AI services are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect voice data from children. If we learn that we have collected data from a child, we will delete it promptly.
